Many of its\ntales involve hatred and jealousy. Have you ever heard of \u201cThe Wings of\nIcarus\u201d? Allow me to summarize. Long ago, in ancient Greece, there lived a\ngreat inventor named Daedalus. Daedalus was ordered by King Minos to\nbuild a great labyrinth in which to imprison the monstrous Minotaur.\nHowever, King Minos soon abandoned Daedalus, confining the inventor to a\ntower alongside his son, Icarus.\nIn order to escape their prison, Daedalus gathered together the feathers\nof many birds in order to fashion a large pair of wings. He connected the\nlarger feathers with thread, and the smaller with wax. Once the wings were\ncompleted and the time had come to fly to freedom, Daedalus gave Icarus a\nwarning.\nHe said, \u201cIf you fly too high, the sun will melt the wax holding the\nwings together. Be careful.\u201d With that warning in mind, Icarus leapt from the\ntower alongside his father. Together, they gained their freedom. But freedom\ncan be a dangerous thing, and can make a person lose sight of himself. With\nsuch boundless freedom before him, Icarus started to get carried away.\nPerhaps it was inevitable after breaking free from such painful restraints.\nIcarus, blissful, forgot his father\u2019s warning and flew higher and higher.\nThe sun burned the false angel wings that his father had constructed, and in\nthe blink of an eye, the wax melted. Eventually, the false wings were\ncompletely burned away. Icarus fell into the sea and died. Was Icarus a brave\nyoung man who jumped into the sky to gain his freedom? Or was he an\narrogant fool who overestimated his abilities and believed that he could reach\nthe sun? Perhaps no one save for his father, Daedalus, will ever know the\nanswer to that.\nFor some reason, I thought of Icarus\u2019 wings when standing before a\ncertain young boy. Considering what these past few months had brought, I\ncould say that I made the comparison simply because he resembled Icarus.\n", "But I immediately came to realize that the two boys were fundamentally\ndifferent from one another. This boy possessed neither the bravery nor the\narrogance of Icarus.\nI had been pushed into a corner. I had no choice but to do it.\nLacking the means to deal with it, I had no choice but to incur this\nboy\u2019s divine wrath. I had no choice but to conduct myself firmly, turning this\nboy\u2019s quiet rage toward me. The die cannot be returned once cast. The\ngamble had already begun.\n", "Chapter 2:\nThe Boundary Between\nHeaven and Hell\nThe endless summer sea. The infinite blue skies. The perfectly clear\nair. Here, in the midst of the Pacific Ocean, we didn\u2019t feel the intense\nmidsummer heat, and the gentle sea breeze kissed our bodies. Yes, this really\nwas an oceanic paradise.\n\u201cWhoa! This is the beeeeeeesssssst!\u201d shouted Ike Kenji, both hands\nraised high in the air. His voice echoed across the deck of the luxury liner.\nNormally, someone would have grumbled or shouted \u201cshut up\u201d in\nresponse. But just for today, no one minded, instead enjoying this moment of\nbliss. The view from the \u201cspecial seats\u201d on the deck was exceptionally\ngorgeous.\n\u201cThis view is incredible! I\u2019m honestly super moved right now!\u201d\nA group of girls led by Karuizawa came out from the ship\u2019s cabin.\nKaruizawa pointed out to the expansive ocean, wearing a radiant smile.\n\u201cSeriously, the scenery here is just amazing!\u201d\nKushida Kikyou was also present among the group of girls. It looked\nlike the extraordinary view had stolen her breath away.\nAfter overcoming numerous hardships, midterms, and the final exam,\nwe had welcomed summer vacation with open arms. The Advanced\nNurturing High School had arranged for an extravagant two-week trip\u2014a\ncruise on a luxury liner.\n\u201cWow, Ken, you must be happy you didn\u2019t get expelled. I mean, if this\nwere a normal trip, it would\u2019ve been impossible for us to go. Hey, how did it\nfeel to be on the verge of expulsion, since you had the lowest score on the\nfinal? Come on, tell me. How did it feel?\u201d\nEven though Yamauchi Haruki was insulting him, Sudou Ken was far\nfrom being in a foul mood. In fact, he howled with laughter in response,\nsounding more like the baying of a lone wolf than a high schooler.\n", "\u201cWith my skills, there was nothing to worry about. Didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d\nprove myself, and it\u2019d be easy?\u201d\nWe had faced oblivion just a short while ago, but this trip completely\nblew those feelings away. Perhaps the blue seas had washed away our\neveryday troubles.\n\u201cI never dreamed that high schoolers could go on such a luxurious\ncruise. And it\u2019s for two whole weeks. Two weeks! When my mom and dad\nhear about this, they\u2019re gonna be so shocked they\u2019ll wet themselves!\u201d\nAs Sudou had bluntly stated, this was certainly no ordinary trip. At our\ngovernment-sponsored school, there was absolutely no need for us to pay for\ntuition or other miscellaneous expenses\u2014which, of course, included this trip.\nWe received the best of special treatment. The cruise liner and its facilities\nwere of the highest possible quality. This ship was fully equipped with\neverything from prestigious restaurants to a theater, and even an upscale spa.\nOn my own, this would probably have cost me about 100,000 yen, even in\nthe off season.\nOur trip, which promised the pinnacle of luxury, had finally started\ntoday. According to the schedule, we would spend our first week staying at a\nfancy summer lodge on a deserted island. After that, we would enjoy the\ncruise ship for another week.\nAt 5 AM today, the first-year students had boarded buses and departed\nfor Tokyo Bay. The passenger ships departed from the port once the students\narrived. After eating breakfast in the lounge, students were permitted to move\nfreely throughout the entire vessel. Best of all, we were able to use any of the\nship\u2019s facilities free of charge. For those of us who\u2019d suffered daily due to a\nlack of points, this ship was heaven-sent.\nSuddenly, Kushida turned toward me. I could tell that something was\non her mind. With the vast ocean and the endless blue sky behind her,\nKushida looked even more radiant than usual. Even though I didn\u2019t want it to,\nmy heart started to pound. Could it be\u2026?\n\u201cHuh? Come to think of it, I wonder where Horikita-san is? Weren\u2019t\nyou two together?\u201d Kushida asked.\nApparently I wasn\u2019t even allowed to indulge in a mere fantasy.\nKushida had Horikita on her mind.\n", "\u201cWho knows? I\u2019m not her keeper.\u201d I didn\u2019t recall seeing her after\nbreakfast.\n\u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t enjoy traveling, so maybe she\u2019s in her room?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\u201cAround noon, we can go onto the island\u2019s private beach and swim\naround as much as we want. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d\nApparently, the school owned a small island to the south. Our\ndestination.\n\u201cAttention, students. Please assemble on the deck. You will be able to\nsee the island soon. This is a good time to take in some rather significant\nscenery.\u201d\nThis rather strange announcement issued from the ship\u2019s PA. Kushida\nand the others didn\u2019t seem to mind, looking forward to what was to come.\nThe island appeared on the horizon a few minutes after several students had\ngathered. Ike let out a gleeful cry.\nOther students noticed, and began assembling on the deck. After a\ncrowd had gathered, some particularly domineering boys showed up and\nbegan pushing us out of the way in order to get the best position.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re in the way. Move it, you defects.\u201d\nOne of the boys tried to intimidate me, and shoved my shoulder. In a\npanic, I quickly grabbed onto the deck\u2019s railing to keep from falling. The\nstudents laughed scornfully.\n\u201cHey, what the hell are you guys doing?!\u201d\nSudou immediately responded in kind, trying to intimidate them right\nback. Kushida, looking worried, came to my side. I suppose men who require\ngirls for backup probably look pretty pathetic.\n\u201cYou do understand how this school is structured, right? Class D\ndoesn\u2019t get any human rights. Defects like you are just that\u2014defective\u2014so\nyou should submit. We\u2019re all in Class A over here.\u201d\nThe students from Class D departed from the bow of the ship as if we\u2019d\nbeen chased out. Sudou looked displeased, but managed to restrain himself.\nA fistfight didn\u2019t break out, evidence that he was perhaps growing up. Or\n", "perhaps he simply understood Class D\u2019s weak position here. Although the\nsituation was unfair, we didn\u2019t need any unnecessary trouble, so it was best to\nignore it.\n\u201cOh, hey, you\u2019re all here. Huh? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nHirata Yousuke, Class D\u2019s leader, called out to me. It was the last day\nof the first semester. The cabin assignments for the trip were decided. I\nhadn\u2019t expected to be called over to hang out with Ike and Sudou and the\nothers; their group was already big enough as it was. Just when it seemed like\nI would be isolated, though, I was saved by the appearance of my hero, Hirata\nMan.\n\u201cHey, Hirata, how far have you gotten with Karuizawa?\u201d Ike asked\nHirata, who didn\u2019t seem to be heading over to Karuizawa\u2019s side. \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou try and be flirtier with her, since we\u2019re on this long-awaited trip?\u201d\n\u201cWe just kind of take things at our own pace.\u201d Hirata\u2019s cell phone rang.\n\u201cOh, sorry, Miyake-kun looks like he\u2019s having trouble. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d\nFiddling with his phone, Hirata returned to the cabins. Popular people\nwere the busiest of all.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his deal? We\u2019re on a trip, but he\u2019s worried about his\nclassmates?\u201d\n\u201cKaruizawa is Karuizawa, though. I guess lately she and Hirata haven\u2019t\nbeen very flirty with each other\u2026 Do you think that maybe they\u2019ve broken\nup? If that\u2019s the case, that really sucks. It\u2019ll mean more rivals to get to\nKushida-chan!\u201d\nIt was certainly true that Hirata and his girlfriend seemed less close\nnow than when they\u2019d started dating. But they didn\u2019t appear to have had a\nfight, and the situation hadn\u2019t gotten tense. They seemed to get along well\nwhenever I saw them talking.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided, Haruki. I\u2026will confess my feelings to Kushida-chan on\nthis trip!\u201d Ike proclaimed.\n\u201cA-are you serious? If she rejects you, it\u2019s gonna be crazy awkward,\nthough. You gonna be okay?\u201d\n\u201cThis is just my own selfish reasoning. Kushida-chan is really cute,\nright? That\u2019s why most of the boys want to ask her out. But she\u2019s just on a\n", "whole other level, so no one can get the courage to confess to her. That\nmeans she\u2019s not used to being confessed to, right? I think Kushida-chan\u2019s\nheart could be shaken by my declaration of love. It\u2019s like, you know, not\nentirely hopeless.\u201d\n\u201cI see. So, you\u2019ve already made up your mind.\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\nNormally Yamauchi would have gotten fired up and opposed Ike, but\nthis time he didn\u2019t. Instead, he looked out over the deck as if searching for\nsomething.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Ike asked.\n\u201cAh, nothing really,\u201d Yamauchi responded absent-mindedly. In the\nend, he never brought up the subject of Kushida.\n\u201cHey, hey, Kushida-chan. Can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d Ike asked.\n\u201cHmm? What is it?\u201d\nIke immediately approached Kushida, who had been looking at the sea.\nThis was obviously a suspicious move.\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s like this\u2026 It\u2019s been about four months since we met, right?\nSo\u2026I was wondering if it might be okay for me to call you by your first\nname now. I mean, it makes me feel like we\u2019re strangers when I call you by\nyour last name.\u201d\n\u201cCome to think of it, I guess you and Yamauchi have been calling each\nother by your first names for a while now, huh?\u201d Kushida said.\n\u201cSo\u2026 I can\u2019t, huh? C-call you Kikyou-chan, I mean?\u201d\nIn response to Ike\u2019s inquiry, Kushida simply smiled.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay for you to call me that. Should I call you Kanji-\nkun, then?\u201d\n\u201cWhooooaaaaa! Kikyou-chaaaaaaan!\u201d Ike cried out and posed like he\nwas reaching out to heaven, kind of like the guy on the poster for the movie\nPlatoon. Kushida chuckled.\n\u201cFirst names, huh? Hey, speaking of, I wonder what Horikita\u2019s first\nname is? Huh?\u201d Sudou asked me as if I was the one who\u2019d know.\n", "\u201cTomiko. Horikita Tomiko.\u201d\n\u201cTomiko, huh? That\u2019s a cute name. Just like I\u2019d expect. It feels perfect\nfor her.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sorry, I was wrong. It\u2019s Suzune.\u201d\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t make mistakes like that! Suzune, huh? It feels like\nTomiko, but it\u2019s 100 times better.\u201d\nIn the end, even if Horikita\u2019s first name were Sadako or Sam or\nwhatever, he probably would have felt it was perfect.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call her by her first name during our summer vacation,\ntoo. Suzune. Suzune\u2026\u201d\nWell, it seemed the boys wanted to bridge the gap between themselves\nand the girls. It should be noted that none of the guys called me by my first\nname, and I didn\u2019t call them by theirs.\n\u201cOh, hey. Let me practice with you, Ayanokouji. Practice saying\nSuzune\u2019s name, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cPractice? What do you mean, practice? That\u2019s not a normal thing to\ndo.\u201d\nIt was pointless to practice saying someone\u2019s name unless you were\nsaying it to the person in question. Sudou glared at me intently. He wasn\u2019t\nplanning to make me his imaginary Horikita, was he? It was probably\nbecause he was imagining me as someone of the opposite sex, but the look in\nhis eyes really creeped me out. In my mind, I started breathing heavily.\n\u201cHey, Horikita, do you have a minute? There\u2019s something I want to\ntalk to you about\u2026\u201d Sudou murmured.\n\u201cI\u2019m not Horikita.\u201d Disgusted, I averted my eyes.\n\u201cYou freakin\u2019 moron! It\u2019s practice! I don\u2019t wanna do it, either, but I got\nto practice, you know? It\u2019s like I have to practice basketball if I want to get\ngood. In either case, I need to take my shot.\u201d\nI really didn\u2019t want to listen to this, but I didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\nI had to grin and bear it.\n\u201cHorikita. Isn\u2019t it weird that we talk to each other like we\u2019re strangers?\nWe\u2019ve known each other for a while now. Other people are calling each other\n", "by their first names. Isn\u2019t it time we did, too?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nI wanted to hit Sudou on the head, but I tried to endure it like an adult.\n\u201cSay something! Why aren\u2019t you practicing?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d\n\u201cAnswer like how Horikita would. You\u2019ve known her for a long time,\nso you\u2019d know how she\u2019d answer, right?\u201d\nWe had only known each other for four months, so I wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily know that. Even so, Sudou had asked me to play his imaginary\nHorikita. I clenched my fist in a somewhat threatening manner.\n\u201cI\u2019m one step ahead on the path to adulthood. You want me to practice\nthis with you instead of Horikita? Feel free to practice by yourself.\u201d\nIke jumped in to substitute for me instead. Sudou seemed kind of weird\nwhen he started talking.\n\u201cHorikita\u2026is it okay for me to call you by your first name now?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Well, you\u2019re not exactly a hottie, are you, Sudou-kun? And you\ndon\u2019t seem to have any money, so, like, you\u2019re not my type at all, are you?\nOr it\u2019s, like, sorry, sorry, but no thanks, you know?!\u201d\nDespite looking nothing like one, Ike was trying to play the part of a\ngyaru high school girl. Sudou put him in a chokehold until he writhed in\nagony on the deck. Those guys always seemed so energetic. I felt exhausted\njust looking at them. Still, they did look pretty funny.\nA little while later, the crowd started getting riled up and making noise.\nThe students\u2019 enthusiasm increased by leaps and bounds as we sailed closer\nand the island became clearer.\nI\u2019d thought that the ship would have gone directly to the island, but for\nsome reason we passed the pier and started circling around. The island, on\nloan from the government, had a surface area of about 0.5 square kilometers.\nThe highest point of the island reached 230 meters. In comparison to Japan\u2019s\ntotal area, the island was tiny, but when seen by one hundred-odd people on a\ncruise ship, it looked unbelievably massive.\nEventually, the boat made a complete pass around the island. The ship\n", "continued to circle without changing speed, barely making a splash as it\nmoved almost unnaturally fast through the water.\n\u201cSuch a mysterious sight! It\u2019s so moving! Don\u2019t you think so,\nAyanokouji-kun?\u201d Kushida gushed.\n\u201cO-oh. Yeah, I guess.\u201d\nAs I looked at Kushida, whose eyes sparkled as she looked at the\ndeserted island, my heart started to pound. Kushida really was cute. I wanted\nto protect her smile, and her childlike mannerisms.\n", "An announcement came over the PA speakers. \u201cWe will disembark in\nthirty minutes. Please assemble on the deck. All students should have\nchanged into their jerseys. Make sure to check your designated bag and your\nluggage, and do not forget your cell phone. Please keep all other personal\nitems in your room. There is a possibility that you will not be able to visit the\nbathroom for some time, so please do so now.\u201d\nApparently, the private beach was near. Ike and the others went to\nchange in high spirits. I started heading toward my group\u2019s room, too. There,\nI put on the jersey that I used for gym class, returned to the ship\u2019s deck, and\nwaited until we reached the island. As the island drew closer and closer, the\nfirst-years\u2019 enthusiasm reached its peak.\n\u201cWe will disembark now, beginning with the students from Class A.\nCell phones are prohibited on the island. Please hand your phone to your\nhomeroom teacher as you leave.\u201d\nFollowing the loudspeaker\u2019s command, the students went down the\nstairs in an orderly fashion.\n\u201cCome on. Hurry up! Even though we\u2019re wearing thin clothes, we\u2019re\nall sweating!\u201d\nThere was no place to hide from the sun on the ship\u2019s deck. No surprise\nthat people were complaining. The Class D students waited on standby in the\nheat. Horikita finally joined us. At first glance, it didn\u2019t appear as though\nanything had changed, but there was a slight difference\u2014something felt out\nof place. Even Horikita, normally so meticulous, was concerned about her\nappearance. Right now, though, her hair was disheveled.\nShe seemed a bit cold, unconsciously rubbing her arms as we waited to\ndisembark and set foot on the island.\n\u201cWhat were you doing until now?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI was just reading a book in my room. For Whom the Bell Tolls. You\nwouldn\u2019t know it.\u201d\nHey, come on now , I thought. That book was arguably one of Ernest\nHemingway\u2019s definitive works, an unquestioned masterpiece. I\u2019d long been\nimpressed by Horikita\u2019s hobby of reading such acclaimed books. But I had to\nwonder what her priorities were, since she was reading while on a luxurious\ncruise. In such a case, I found it a little suspicious that she would shut herself\n", "off in her room to read.\nShe wasn\u2019t saying anything, and it would be silly to investigate further.\nBest just to drop it.\n\u201cI\u2019m anxious about what\u2019s coming, but since we\u2019re prohibited from\nbringing personal items along there\u2019s nothing I can really do,\u201d she grumbled,\nseemingly dissatisfied.\nUnusual for someone headed to the beach to say.\nDisembarking took longer than I thought it would, probably because\nthe teachers guarded the students on both sides as they got off the ship and\nchecked their luggage.\n\u201cHey. Does it seem like they\u2019re being strangely cautious right now? On\ntheir guard? I mean, they didn\u2019t even confiscate our cell phones during the\nfinal. They\u2019re really cracking down on the personal items.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly seems that way. I mean, if we\u2019re just playing in the ocean,\nI can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d need to go this far.\u201d\nSpeaking of unnatural, there was a helicopter parked on the stern of the\nboat. While it was true that some things were bothering me, I was probably\noverthinking it. If students did bring their cell phones to the beach,\nsomeone\u2019s phone might get wet and break. And they probably didn\u2019t want\npersonal items because they were worried about people polluting the beach\nwith garbage. And if someone suddenly got ill, the helicopter was there for\ndispatch, right?\nSoon, it would be our turn to be examined and get off the ramp. I had\nyet to realize that this place was going to be the boundary between heaven\nand hell.\n", "2.1\nAs we got off the boat, chatting amiably with one another, our\nhomeroom teacher greeted us with some harsh words.\n\u201cI will now start roll call for Class D. When you hear your name,\nplease respond loud and clear.\u201d\nOur homeroom teacher started taking attendance, clipboard in hand,\nwhile simultaneously instructing us to form a line. Chabashira-sensei wore\nthe same kind of jersey as her students. This atmosphere was more akin to\ntraining camp than summer vacation. Still, not many of the students seemed\ntense at all.\n\u201cOh, come on! I want my free time already! The sea is right in front of\nme!\u201d Ike muttered, standing directly behind me.\nMost of the students wanted to run off onto the sandy beach. Soon\nenough, a tall teacher stepped onto a prepared white platform. It was\nMashima-sensei, Class A\u2019s homeroom teacher. He normally taught English,\nand was well-known for having a stubborn disposition. At first glance, he\ncould easily be mistaken for one of those bodybuilder types. He was built like\na professional wrestler, but was actually quite intelligent. He\u2019d even taught\nspecial courses in the past.\n\u201cFirst, I would like to say that I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve arrived safely.\nHowever, it\u2019s unfortunate that one of you was unable to participate due to\nillness.\u201d\n\u201cOh wow, someone couldn\u2019t come on the trip because he was sick?\nPoor guy,\u201d said Ike quietly, so the teachers wouldn\u2019t hear. He certainly had a\npoint.\nIf this were some kind of dinky field trip, that\u2019d be one thing, but such\na luxurious vacation was another story altogether. I wondered if that kid\nwould regret not coming after hearing friends talk about it. Even in poor\nhealth, I think he should\u2019ve pushed himself and participated. Oddly enough,\nthe teachers themselves looked rather grim. Well, while this was a vacation\nfor us students, maybe the teachers supervising us had to think of it as a job.\nNo. Somehow, it seemed more than that. While Mashima-sensei\n", "surveyed the students in silence, I could see that adults in uniform had started\nsetting up some kind of special tent nearby. I also saw a computer and other\nequipment on a long table. This increasingly business-like setup didn\u2019t match\nthe natural splendor around us at all, and many of the students looked\nperplexed.\nMashima-sensei uttered a few cruel words, as if waiting for the\natmosphere to change. \u201cWell then. We shall commence the current academic\nyear\u2019s first special test.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Special test? What do you mean?\u201d\nAlmost everyone in our class asked some variation on that question.\nWe\u2019d all thought this was just a class trip, only to be hit by this surprise\nattack. Our summer vacation was a product of the school\u2019s goodwill, but that\nhad been an illusion. We plummeted from relief into stark tension.\n\u201cThe test commences now and lasts for one week, concluding on\nAugust 7th at the year\u2019s end. This test will determine if you can live on a\ndeserted island together as a group. In addition, I should warn you that this\nspecial test is both practical and realistic, designed based on real-world\ncorporate training.\u201d\n\u201cLiving on a deserted island. Does that mean we\u2019re not staying on the\nboat, but the island?\u201d\nSome students from Class B and C voiced their obvious concerns.\n\u201cYou are correct. During the test, you will not be allowed to board the\nship without a suitably justifiable reason. It will be necessary for you to fend\nfor yourselves on this island while you are here, from creating a place to\nsleep to preparing food to eat. Once the test starts, each class will receive two\ntents, and two flashlights. You will be provided with one box of matches.\nThere is no limit to the amount of sunscreen you can have. Each student will\nbe provided with one toothbrush. As a special case, girls will be allowed to\nhave as many feminine sanitary products as they\u2019d like, without any\nrestrictions. Please ask your respective homeroom teachers for those. That is\nall.\u201d\nWith that, the teachers began distributing the items.\n\u201cHuh?! So we have to live like survivors on a deserted island?! I don\u2019t\nwant to hear this kind of insanity! This isn\u2019t an anime or a manga or\n", "something! We can\u2019t all sleep together in just two tents! And what are we\nsupposed to do about food in the first place? This is unbelievable!\u201d\nIke fussed loud enough for everyone to hear. Developing skills of self-\nsufficiency on a deserted island\u2014hunting wild animals, washing in the river,\nbuilding bedding from tree branches\u2014it certainly was like something you\u2019d\nsee in a movie or read about in a book. No one could\u2019ve imagined that the\nschool would put us through a test like this.\nMashima-sensei gave no sign that this was some kind of joke. If\nanything, he appeared surprised by what Ike had said.\n\u201cYou may say this is unbelievable, but that\u2019s because you\u2019ve lived a\nshort, superficial life. There is an actual, prominent company that holds\ntraining sessions on uninhabited islands.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? B-but this\u2026this isn\u2019t special at all. Is it? Isn\u2019t it too much to ask\nfor us to start living on a deserted island with no warning? No way! This is\nunreal!\u201d\n\u201cKeeping on like that would be shameful, Ike, so stop talking. What\nMashima-sensei just said is only part of it. There are many companies in the\nworld with many different training activities. There are workplaces where\nthere aren\u2019t any chairs in the office, and companies that decide salaries with\ndice rolls. The world is wider and deeper than you even know.\u201d\nChabashira-sensei, as if unable to overlook Ike running his mouth,\nchided him. She continued, \u201cIn other words, you are ill-equipped to\ndistinguish between what is reality and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\nMany of the students appeared unconvinced and wore dissatisfied\nlooks.\n\u201cI assume you\u2019re all thinking something like, \u2018What does this test\nmean?\u2019 Or perhaps some of you doubt the existence of such training\nprograms. However, students who remain at such a base level of thought are\nunlikely to become anyone promising in the future. What is your basis for\ndetermining this to be \u2018unbelievable\u2019 or \u2018ridiculous\u2019? You\u2019re just students. In\nmy opinion, you\u2019re all equally worthless. What kind of insignificant person\ndetermines that they can criticize a leading company? That\u2019s bizarre. Were\nyou a president in charge of one such notable business, then you might have\nsome right to deny our claims. However, there shouldn\u2019t be any grounds for\n", "someone of your station to be able to do that.\u201d\nAs we listened, we did certainly determine that parts sounded\nunreasonable or unrealistic. But, just like Mashima-sensei said, we had no\nbasis to oppose their claims. Those who found this beyond the realm of their\nunderstanding could call it \u201cbizarre\u201d or \u201cunbelievable,\u201d but for someone who\ndid understand the point, well, it would be absurd to think otherwise.\n\u201cBut, teacher, isn\u2019t this supposed to be our summer vacation? We were\nbrought here under the pretext of going on a relaxing trip. Don\u2019t you think\nthat bringing us here and then springing this corporate training on us could be\nconsidered unfair?\u201d\nSome of the students in our class began to protest along these lines.\n\u201cI see. I suppose that you\u2019re not wrong about that. I can understand\nwhy you would be discontented.\u201d\nMashima-sensei\u2019s response showed that he recognized the soundness\nof such an argument, unlike Ike\u2019s complaints. There were students who were\ndissatisfied with the current situation, and those who were dissatisfied with\nthe process as a whole.\n\u201cHowever, please do not worry. It would make sense for you to have\ncomplaints if you were being forced into a harsh situation. However, even\nthough we\u2019re calling it a special test, there\u2019s no need to think about it in such\nunhappy terms. In the coming week, you can go swimming, or hold a\nbarbecue. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad time for you to occasionally have a campfire\nand chat with friends, either. The theme of this special exam is \u2018freedom\u2019,\nafter all.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Huh? The theme is freedom? We can have a barbecue? Hmm?\nAnd this is still called a test? I\u2019m so confused\u2026\u201d\nEven though this was a test, we were free to play. The contradiction\nconfused the students, and our doubts only increased.\n\u201cAs a major part of this special test, we\u2019ve decided to distribute 300\npoints to each class. By using your points well, you might be able to enjoy\nthis week\u2019s special test just as you would a normal trip. We\u2019ve also prepared\na manual just for that purpose.\u201d\nMashima-sensei received a booklet that looked to be a few dozen pages\n", "thick from another teacher.\n\u201cThis manual lists all of the ways you can obtain points. It also\nexplains where to get drinking water and food, as well as essential\nnecessities. If you wanted to have a barbecue, it explains how to prepare the\nequipment and ingredients. We also have numerous tools for you to be able\nto enjoy playing in the ocean to the fullest.\u201d\nGradually, the students\u2019 grim expressions grew calmer.\n\u201cSo, we can do whatever we want with the 300 points?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s possible to arrange for anything using your points. Of\ncourse, it\u2019s necessary for you to use them in a systematic way, but with a\nsolid plan, you can spend your week without any difficulties.\u201d\nIf we could really get through the week by using the points we had,\nthen this would be more like a vacation than a test. It might end up feeling\nlike a real summer vacation.\n\u201cB-but, teacher. You said this was a test, right? So shouldn\u2019t there be\nsome kind of difficulty to it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing difficult. It won\u2019t even have any adverse effects\non your second semester. I guarantee it.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s really okay for us to just have fun for one week?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re all free to do what you want. Of course, there are\nsome bare minimum rules that you need to abide by as a group, but there\nshouldn\u2019t be anything difficult about that.\u201d\nIf that were true, then did that mean there really was no risk? In that\ncase, we should ask if he could explain the purpose of this test. Was it linked\nto some kind of exchange between grade levels? I couldn\u2019t understand the\nschool\u2019s true intentions, but Mashima-sensei\u2019s next statement clarified\neverything.\n\u201cWhen this special test period is over, each class\u2019 remaining points will\nbe added to their total class points. Your point totals will reflect this change\nonce summer vacation is over.\u201d\nAs he spoke, a gust of wind blew across the beach and kicked up a\ncloud of dust.\n", "Mashima-sensei\u2019s words were the greatest shock of the day. In\nprevious examinations, they\u2019d measured things like our academic abilities.\nNaturally, this was advantageous for students with a fundamentally high level\nof academic ability. Each time, we in Class D were forced into situations\nwhere we\u2019d lose class points. However, the rules were completely different\nthis time. This test was designed in a way that didn\u2019t create too much of a gap\nbetween Classes A and D.\n\u201cSo if we can endure this for one week, then starting next month we\ncould see a huge increase in our allowance?!\u201d Ike asked.\nThat\u2019s right\u2026 This wasn\u2019t a competition to test our scholarly abilities,\nbut our endurance. If we managed to curb our basic desires, we might get\ncloser to being the top class.\n\u201cEach class will receive one copy of the manual. If the manual is lost,\nyou may have another copy. However, it will consume points, so please be\nvery careful. Also, the student who was marked absent from this trip was\nfrom Class A. According to the rules of this special test, should any student\nhave to leave due to illness, there will be a thirty-point penalty to the class as\na whole. Therefore, Class A will be starting with 270 points.\u201d\nEven though it didn\u2019t affect our class, the penalty was still merciless.\nThe students from Class A were visibly trembling. The other classes also\nappeared shocked. As soon as Mashima-sensei had finished speaking, he told\nus to disperse. Another teacher\u2019s voice came over the loudspeaker, telling us\nthat each class would receive supplementary instructions from our respective\nhomeroom teachers. We then gathered around Chabashira-sensei. The four\nclasses had congregated in order to keep some distance from each other.\n\u201cThirty thousand points next month, thirty thousand points next month,\nthirty thousand points next month. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\nIke and the others struck victorious poses. The girls happily discussed\nwhat things they would buy. Class D\u2019s dearest wish was to increase our\npoints. We just had to spend one week without any luxuries.\nIt certainly sounded simple.\n\u201cI will now hand out wristwatches to every one of you. You are not to\ntake them off until the end of the test. If you remove your wristwatch without\npermission, you will be punished. This watch doesn\u2019t just tell time. Its\n", "sensors also check your body temperature, your pulse, and even your\nmovements. It\u2019s equipped with a GPS . Also, in the off chance something bad\ndoes happen, this watch comes equipped with the means to notify the school.\nIf you find yourself in an emergency situation, please do not hesitate to push\nthat button.\u201d\nThe vendor who supplied the watches had stacked them next to\nChabashira-sensei. The time had come for Class D to collect our supplies.\nWe were instructed to take the watches out of their boxes and put them on.\n\u201cWhen you say an emergency, do you mean, like, if a bear shows up?\u201d\n\u201cEven if that was a joke, the test has already begun. I cannot answer\nany questions that might possibly influence your results.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026that\u2019s a kinda freaky answer.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any wild animals here. If one of the students\nwere injured, that would be a big problem. They probably gave us these\nwatches solely to manage our well-being. Don\u2019t you agree? We\u2019re on an\nuninhabited island, after all, and the school has to ensure our safety,\u201d Hirata\nsaid.\nIndeed, the school had gifted us these watches to keep us safe. If we\nwere roaming freely about the island, the teachers wouldn\u2019t be able to\nmonitor our condition with their eyes alone. Plus, it would be difficult to\ninstall cameras here, like inside of the school. They most likely intended to\nmonitor our physical condition so they could respond to any unforeseen\ncircumstances. The helicopter back on the ship was probably there in case of\njust such an emergency. As people received their watches, they placed them\non either their right or left arm, according to their preferences.\n\u201cIs it okay for us to get in the water wearing these?\u201d\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problem. They\u2019re waterproof. However,\nshould they malfunction, immediately report to a test administrator and\nexchange it for a replacement.\u201d\nThis special test was somewhat eccentric in its design, so it likely\nwasn\u2019t the first time that the school had run it. Clearly, they had planned for\nvarious situations. However, there might have been some oversights.\n\u201cChabashira-sensei. I understand that we\u2019re going to be spending one\n", "week on this island, but is it possible to get by without using any points?\u201d\n\u201cHmm. Well, the school isn\u2019t involved in the test process at all. That\nmeans that you must prepare your own food and water. Thinking of solutions\nto resolve the issue is part of the test. I don\u2019t know of any way of doing so\nwithout points.\u201d\nThe girls looked visibly more perplexed than the boys. The fact that a\nbed wasn\u2019t guaranteed probably made them feel uneasy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If we can catch fish and pick fruit in the forest, then\nwe\u2019ll be fine. We can also use leaves and trees to make tents and stuff. And\neven if you start not feeling great, do your best!\u201d Ike said, seemingly without\nany worry at all. He was determined to preserve the 300 points.\nEven if Ike would be fine living like that, our class comprised more\nthan thirty students. Obtaining what everyone needed probably wouldn\u2019t be\nthat easy.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ike, but I don\u2019t think things will go as you\u2019ve planned.\nOpen your manual.\u201d\nHirata did as Chabashira-sensei instructed.\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d like you to read the last page, where the penalties are listed.\nThis is very important information that encapsulates the difficulties of this\nspecial test. It will determine whether you live or die.\u201d\nOn the last page, a line read, \u201cThese penalties will be applied to anyone\nwho falls under the following conditions.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone deemed unable to continue the test due to significant\ndeterioration in health or serious injury will be penalized by thirty points.\nThat student will then retire.\u201d\n\u201cIn the event a student has polluted the environment, he or she will be\npenalized twenty points.\u201d\n\u201cIn the event students are absent during the 8 AM or 8 PM roll call, five\npoints will be taken for each student absent.\u201d\nHowever, the most serious punishment was detailed in the fourth entry\non the list. \u201cIn the event a student is found guilty of an act of violence toward\nanother class, robbing another class, or causing damage to another class\u2019\nproperty, etc., the offending student\u2019s class will immediately be disqualified,\n", "and the individual will forfeit all of his or her private points.\u201d\nIt looked like Class A was subject to these same penalties. The fourth\nrule was totally reasonable, written to prevent students from engaging in\nharmful behavior, while the other three rules were clearly there so individual\nstudents wouldn\u2019t behave carelessly. Because we had roll call in the morning\nand at night, it was impossible to sleep your time away at camp. It was also\nmeant to suppress rather barbaric behavior, like a student littering\neverywhere.\nEssentially, it was a contest of restraint.\n\u201cYou are free to behave as you wish. However, if ten students fall into\npoor health, then all your efforts will be for nothing. Once a student has\nretired from the test, he or she cannot come back.\u201d\nThe students who had thought it possible to get through the test by\nrelying on their own endurance now looked perplexed. It would be\nimpossible not to spend a single point, but that was true of every class.\nHowever, whether you actively participated or resigned yourself to your fate\nin this test, endurance alone would not win the day here.\nHow would we use our points effectively, save them, and get through\nthe week?\nGradually, the shape of this very literal \u201cspecial test\u201d became clearer.\n\u201cIn other words, using at least some points is unavoidable?\u201d asked a\ngirl named Shinohara, who\u2019d been following along in the conversation.\n\u201cI disagree with the idea of compromising right away. I think that we\nought to persevere for as long as we can.\u201d\n\u201cI understand how you feel, but it\u2019ll be bad if our health suffers.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Hirata, don\u2019t be so discouraging! This is a test of our\npatience, right?\u201d\nThe more we understood the rules, the less we could agree on a course\nof action. Our opinions were divided. At any rate, there were a wide variety\nof items for purchase in the manual: essential equipment for surviving, like\ntents and cookware; machines and tools, like digital cameras and wireless\ntransceivers/walkie-talkies; items for amusement, like umbrellas, floaties,\nstuff for a barbecue, and fireworks; and food and water, the bare essentials.\n", "We could prepare for anything with our points. Apparently anyone\ncould request something, and just report to their homeroom teacher in order\nto use points to purchase it.\n\u201cChabashira-sensei, can I ask you something? In the event that\nsomeone were to retire after we had already used all 300 points, what would\nhappen?\u201d asked Horikita, her hand raised.\n\u201cIn that case, all that would increase is the number of people forced to\nretire. Your points can\u2019t be changed any more after reaching zero.\u201d\n\u201cSo, in other words, we can\u2019t get into negative points during the test?\u201d\nChabashira-sensei answered in the affirmative. Mashima-sensei had\nsaid that there wouldn\u2019t be any negative effects from this test. It looked like\nthat was true. Chabashira-sensei continued talking, occasionally glancing at\nher wristwatch to check the time.\n\u201cEach one of the supplied tents is large enough to accommodate eight\npeople. The tents weigh close to fifteen kilos, so please be careful when\ncarrying them. Also, the school will not step in to help should your supplied\nitems become lost or damaged. In the event that you need a new tent,\nremember to use your points.\u201d\n\u201cMay I ask something? Where will roll call be held?\u201d\n\u201cEach class will be accompanied by their respective homeroom\nteachers until the test is over. If you\u2019ve decided where you want your base\ncamp to be, report it. Once the base is set up, I will hold roll call there. Make\nsure that you think long and hard about it, because you can\u2019t change your\nbase camp location without a justifiable reason once you\u2019ve decided. The\nother classes are subject to the same conditions. There are no exceptions.\u201d\nDid that mean that Chabashira-sensei was going to spend a week\ntogether with Class D, as our supervisor? Of course, she probably wasn\u2019t\ngoing to help us.\n\u201cHey, teacher. I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you when you\u2019re talking, but that\njuice from earlier went right through me. Where\u2019s the toilet?\u201d\nSudou appeared before us, like he hadn\u2019t heard the announcement.\n\u201cThe toilet, huh? I was about to get to that point. If you want to use the\nbathroom, use this.\u201d\n", "Chabashira-sensei grabbed one of the cardboard boxes from the\nstacked pile. She peeled off the packing tape and took out some collapsed\ncardboard.\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s that?\u201d Sudou asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a basic toilet. Each class will be supplied with one. Please handle\nit carefully.\u201d\nSudou wasn\u2019t the only one perplexed by this. The girls were shocked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me we have to use that ?!\u201d Shinohara, from Karuizawa\u2019s\ngroup, raised her voice in horrified surprise. The girl seemed like an\nextension of Karuizawa herself, rather than a simple group member.\n\u201cBoth the boys and girls will use it. But do not worry, it comes with a\nsingle button tent that you can use when you want to change. That way, no\none will be able to see you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem! Th-that\u2019s just a cardboard box! This is\nabsolutely impossible!\u201d\n\u201cIt might be a cardboard box, but it\u2019s an especially well-made one. It\ncan even be used in a disaster. I\u2019ll show you how to use it, so please commit\nthis to memory.\u201d\nWhile the girls booed her, Chabashira-sensei assembled the toilet. It\nseemed she was familiar with setting it up. Then she put a blue vinyl bag on\nit, and placed what looked to be a white sheet inside.\n\u201cThis sheet is made of water-absorbing polymer. It covers and\nsolidifies waste. It\u2019ll make the waste invisible, and also suppress the smell.\nAfter you finish using it, stack another sheet on top. By repeating this\nprocess, it\u2019s possible to get around five uses with one vinyl bag. These vinyl\nbags and sheets will be supplied to you in unlimited amounts. You can even\nchange them after every use, if you want.\u201d\nThe girls listened silently to Chabashira-sensei\u2019s explanation. If a\ndisaster did occur, it wouldn\u2019t matter whether you were a boy or a girl, or if it\nwas just a cardboard box. But it was probably pretty difficult to imagine this\nidyllic island as a disaster area.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no way I can do this! Absolutely no way!\u201d\nStarting with Shinohara, nearly all of the girls rejected the idea.\n", "Ike, who\u2019d been silent, pouted and said, \u201cCome on, just deal with it.\nThis isn\u2019t the time to fight, Shinohara.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t screw around! It probably doesn\u2019t matter to you boys. There\u2019s\nno way I can go to the bathroom in a cardboard box.\u201d\n\u201cThe decision is yours. However, you are not permitted to relieve\nyourselves in the forest, the sea, or rivers. Do not forget that.\u201d\nEven when giving that warning, our teacher sounded uninterested.\n\u201cBut, but I definitely can\u2019t do it in a cardboard box! Besides, the guys\nare going to be close, right? That\u2019s gross!\u201d\nShinohara, still unaccepting of the situation, directed her anger at the\nboys, especially Ike.\n\u201cWhat the heck? I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re treating us like perverts,\u201d Ike\nsaid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true though, isn\u2019t it? You do seem to be really perverted.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Jeez, that hurts! I\u2019m a super gentleman!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. A gentleman? Get real. You\u2019re by far the top\ncontender for biggest pervert.\u201d\nSparks flew as Ike and Shinohara got into a heated argument.\n\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s impossible for me,\u201d she said.\nShinohara and half of the girls seemed like unwilling to listen to\nreason.\n\u201cWell then, what are you going to do? It\u2019d be impossible for you to not\nuse the bathroom for one whole week, right?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d\nOur teacher, who had calmly watched Ike and Shinohara argue like it\nwasn\u2019t her problem, suddenly looked behind us with a disgusted expression.\n\u201cYoo-hoo!\u201d\nWe heard a piercing voice. Its owner rushed at her target, capturing our\nhomeroom teacher and hugging her tightly from behind.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Chabashira-sensei grunted.\n", "\u201cWhat, I can\u2019t be friendly? I honestly wanted to see what you\u2019d do,\u201d\nsaid Hoshinomiya-sensei, Class B\u2019s homeroom instructor. She gently\ncaressed Chabashira-sensei\u2019s arms. \u201cWhenever I touch your hair, Sae-chan,\nit\u2019s always so smooth!\u201d\n", "\u201cDon\u2019t you understand the school\u2019s rules at all? Eavesdropping on\nother classes when they are giving information is inexcusable.\u201d\n\u201cAw, I\u2019m just an unimportant teacher, though. Even if I did hear\nsomething, I\u2019d never tell. But doesn\u2019t this feel like fate? I can\u2019t believe that\nwe both came to this island together.\u201d\nFate? Chabashira-sensei ignored the hidden meaning in Hoshinomiya-\nsensei\u2019s words.\n\u201cShut up. Just hurry on back to Class B.\u201d\n\u201cAh! Isn\u2019t that Ayanokouji-kun? It\u2019s been so long!\u201d\nUnlike the other teachers, who occasionally popped into class, I didn\u2019t\nnormally get many opportunities to interact with Hoshinomiya-sensei. I gave\nher a slight bow.\n\u201cSummer is the season of love. If you want to confess your feelings to\na girl you like, perhaps it\u2019d be more effective while standing before the\nbeautiful ocean?\u201d\n\u201cThe ocean may be beautiful, but I can\u2019t afford to do that during class.\u201d\nTears streamed down her cheeks. Since everyone was staring at us, I\nreally wished she\u2019d disentangle herself from my romantic life.\n\u201cYou need to be more carefree!\u201d\n\u201cHey. Should I report you to the school authorities for behavioral\nproblems? Besides, I don\u2019t have any more time.\u201d Chabashira-sensei said.\n\u201cOoh, don\u2019t glare at me like that. Fine, fine, I get it. See you later!\u201d\nHoshinomiya-sensei walked away with a sad look on her face.\nChabashira-sensei immediately started on a new topic.\n\u201cWell then, allow me to explain some additional rules.\u201d\n\u201cA-additional rules? There\u2019s more?\u201d\n\u201cSoon you will be permitted to roam about freely, but there are several\ndesignated \u2018spots\u2019 on the island. In these spots, there is what\u2019s referred to as\nright of exclusive possession, and only the class that occupies that spot may\nexercise those rights. The class that obtains those rights is entirely free to\ndetermine how they wish to exercise them. However, rights of exclusive\npossession are only valid for a period of eight hours after being invoked, after\n", "which they are automatically revoked. That means that another class can\nacquire those rights at that time. Also, you gain one bonus point if you\noccupy a spot once. However, that point is provisional, and cannot be used\nduring the testing period. Therefore, bonus points are calculated and added to\nyour total after the test has ended. Because the school is constantly\nmonitoring you, there is no room for fraud. Please be aware of that fact.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Huh? Well\u2026wait, isn\u2019t that super important, though?! Getting\nto add a point is awesome! Leave everything to us!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go looking right away!\u201d Ike said to Yamauchi and the others, his\neyes shining.\nThe manual went into the bonus point in great detail. Apparently, there\nwas some kind of apparatus installed near each spot, one which showed rights\nof exclusive possession. It was unclear how many spots were on the island,\nbut they were clearly important. However\u2026\n\u201cI can understand your impatience, but be aware of the risks. After you\ntake those risks into account, then you have to consider what to do.\nEverything is written in the manual.\u201d\nA specialized key card is required to occupy a spot.\nYou can earn one point by occupying a spot each time. Occupied spots\ncan be used freely.\nYou will receive a fifty-point penalty if you use a spot occupied by\nanother class without permission.\nOnly a designated leader can use the key card.\nIt is impossible to change the leader without suitable justification.\nThe manual outlined those rules. While Chabashira-sensei explained, I\nnoticed details such as how the rights of exclusive possession were reset\nevery eight hours; how if a space wasn\u2019t occupied, you could take it\nimmediately; how it was okay for the same class to occupy the same space\nrepeatedly, etc. So if one class successfully managed to repeatedly hold onto\nthree spots for eight hours at a time, that class could obtain fifty points or\nmore by the end of the test. However, there were big risks associated.\nWith the rules established thus far, it looked like a simple matter of the\nearly bird getting the worm. It seemed like a good system, if you were able to\n", "forcibly occupy spots over and over again.\nBut that was impossible. The final rule detailed why.\nOn the seventh day, the last day of the test, you had the right to guess at\nthe identity of the other class\u2019 leader during roll call. If you managed to get it\nright, then you could obtain fifty points for each correct guess. Conversely,\nthe other class would have to pay fifty points as compensation. If you moved\nto acquire a spot without caution, and your leader was discovered, then you\ncould lose a great number of points. So, high risk, high reward.\nHowever, the guesses couldn\u2019t be hazarded without risk. If you\nhappened to be mistaken, you would suffer a fifty-point penalty for being\nincorrect. In addition, a class whose leader had been found out would lose all\nof the bonus points they\u2019d saved up until then. This rule made it so if you\ndidn\u2019t have much confidence, you would be hesitant to join the battle to\noccupy spots.\n\u201cOne person must be chosen as the leader, no exceptions. However,\nyou are free not to participate. Please tell me once you\u2019ve selected someone.\nAt that time, I will provide you with a key card stamped with the leader\u2019s\nname. You have until roll call today. In the event that you do not decide by\nthen, we will decide for you. That is all.\u201d\nIn other words, the leader\u2019s identity would be discovered if you only\nmanaged to glance at the card. With that, Chabashira-sensei seemingly\nfinished with her explanation. The die was cast. Hirata immediately started\ntaking action.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have time later to think about who should be the leader. First,\nwhere will our base camp be? Do we camp somewhere around here, on the\nbeach? Or do we go into the forest? We need to think carefully about our\nspot.\u201d\nThe manual included a simple map of the island, with only its size and\nthe shape drawn. Things like the total area of the forest and the topography\nwere completely unknown. It was more like a blank sheet of paper.\n\u201cIt looks like we need to fill in the necessary parts ourselves.\u201d A\nballpoint pen had been given to us as well, for that exact purpose.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a spot near the boat where lots of teachers are,\nright?\u201d\n", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not too sure. There may not be anything here.\u201d\nIf there was no water, then there was no food. Building a base in this\nlocation could possibly mean being as far away as possible from convenient\nresources. On top of that, the sunlight would be intense during the day,\nmaking the environment harsh. On the other hand, there would also be risks if\nwe went too far into the forest.\n\u201cMore importantly, I need to use the bathroom. I can\u2019t hold it\nanymore.\u201d\nSudou grabbed the simple toilet that Chabashira-sensei had made. We\nassembled the one-button tent and set it up a short distance away. Shinohara\nand the others observed the situation while huddled tightly together.\nChabashira-sensei retreated. She probably meant to imply, \u201cI\u2019m not getting\ninvolved anymore. Do whatever you want.\u201d\n\u201cHey, Hirata-kun. Isn\u2019t it better to decide ahead of time what we should\ndo about the toilet?\u201d\nThe toilet was definitely going to become an issue before long. The\ngirls\u2019 opinions were reasonable.\n\u201cWell, we can talk about a decision, but in the end don\u2019t we just have\nto grin and bear it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, there could be another way.\u201d\nHirata looked at the manual, and then looked back up.\n\u201cIt says that temporary toilets can be purchased and installed using our\npoints.\u201d\nShinohara and the other immediately gathered around the manual. The\nfunctions of the temporary toilets appeared impeccable. The reference\npictures made it look like a flushable toilet you\u2019d see at home. If that were the\ncase, then the girls would be well on board with it. However, the problem\nwas that we needed to spend twenty points per toilet. It was difficult to judge\nwhether that was expensive or cheap.\n\u201cWe absolutely need it! I mean, I really don\u2019t like that we have to\nspend points\u2026 But if we don\u2019t, it\u2019s just impossible!\u201d\nA lot of girls, triggered by Shinohara\u2019s remarks, agreed. For the girls,\nhaving a toilet might outweigh having food or water. They didn\u2019t intend to\n", "budge on this issue.\n\u201cW-wait a minute here, you guys! Twenty points?! Just for a toilet?!\u201d\nIke reacted with horror. His desire to be economical and save points\nwas all-consuming. Also, some of the guys could put up with using a\ncardboard toilet. They probably wanted to refrain from making unnecessary\npurchases as much as possible.\n\u201cYes, as a toilet, that one\u2019s good. But we already have this one! Right?\nWe still have a lot of time left to use our points. It\u2019s bad for us to splurge\nnow!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide that. Hirata-kun is going to consider all of our\nopinions and decide. Right, Hirata-kun?\u201d Shinohara ignored Ike and pleaded\nwith Hirata to buy a temporary toilet.\n\u201cI see. At the very least, having a toilet for the girls would be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re free to consider everyone\u2019s opinions, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nyou get to make decisions,\u201d said Ike, frantically trying to stop Hirata, who\nappeared to be about to buy the toilet.\n\u201cAh, shut up already! Karuizawa-san, say something, will you? We\nneed a toilet!\u201d Shinohara begged Karuizawa, the girls\u2019 representative.\n\u201cReally? Well, I suppose it\u2019ll be tough, but I really want class points. I\nguess I\u2019ll just grin and bear it.\u201d An unexpected response from Karuizawa,\nwho seemed like she would\u2019ve been first to complain. \u201cThe school has\nalready prepared for our needs. I can endure it. If we take baths in the river\nand use what we have here, don\u2019t you think everything will be fine?\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026Karuizawa-san!\u201d\nIf Karuizawa said as much, then even the strong-willed Shinohara\ncouldn\u2019t oppose her openly. Many of the girls followed Karuizawa, after all.\nHowever, Yukimura suddenly joined the fight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as though I don\u2019t understand the girls\u2019 desire to have a\ntemporary toilet. However, I\u2019m not convinced that we ought to arbitrarily\nspend our points, whether it\u2019s for boys or girls. I suppose if you want the\ntoilet, then I\u2019d like to at least make a decision after collecting a majority\nvote.\u201d\nHe slid his glasses up his nose, voicing his disagreement in a rather\n", "aggressive tone.\n\u201cI\u2019m just making a natural request for a girl, that\u2019s all. It doesn\u2019t\ninvolve boys at all.\u201d\n\u201cA natural request? Doesn\u2019t involve boys? I can\u2019t understand that. Isn\u2019t\nthat simply a form of discrimination?\u201d\n\u201cDiscrimination? Ah, this is giving me a headache. Hirata-kun, please\nmake them leave me alone.\u201d Shinohara, unable to give up on the toilet matter,\nfrantically pleaded for help.\n\u201cThis test is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to bridge our point gap with\nthe other classes. We can\u2019t use valuable points on things like temporary\ntoilets. I have no intention of being in Class D forever. I don\u2019t agree with\nShinohara-san, who\u2019s making arbitrary requests based on her personal\nwishes. I would like for us to uniformly decide upon a clear policy.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Are you trying to say that I\u2019m not considering anything?\u201d she\nasked.\n\u201cEven money can move based purely on instinct. I hate that women\nargue so emotionally.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? That doesn\u2019t mean that I want to use our points indiscriminately.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that we should have at least the bare minimum. Do you\nnot understand that?\u201d\n\u201cBoth of you calm down. Yukimura-kun, I understand what you mean\nto say, but if you speak so belligerently we\u2019re not going to resolve anything,\nare we? Let\u2019s do this calmly.\u201d\n\u201cCalmly? Don\u2019t you agree that we should, under no circumstances, use\nour points arbitrarily?\u201d Yukimura asked.\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nHirata was caught in an increasingly fraught situation. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do, yet frantically tried to mediate while doing his best not to show\nmounting concern.\n\u201cClass D has no leadership, which worries me. Besides, Hirata\u2019s a\npushover. He can\u2019t even make one decision, can he?\u201d\nI stood a short distance away, watching the situation unfold. Horikita\n", "stood next to me. After realizing that it was unlikely any progress would be\nmade, she sighed heavily.\n\u201cIt looks like this test is going to be more complex and challenging\nthan we thought\u2026\u201d\nHorikita, oddly enough, looked perplexed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance for us to get a lot of points. Are you okay, Horikita?\u201d\nWhen I looked at her in profile, she appeared a little annoyed rather\nthan conflicted.\n\u201cI wonder. At this stage, I\u2019m not optimistic enough to say it\u2019ll be easy.\nI\u2019m the same as the others. I\u2019ve never lived in such an environment before, so\nI can\u2019t really make any predictions. I realize now that this test is more\ncomplicated than we thought, and our position more precarious. I do want to\nincrease our points, but I can\u2019t come up with a good solution. What an\nunpleasant test.\u201d\nOne group wanted to use points, one group didn\u2019t want to use points,\nand one group wanted to use points only when necessary. Those were three\nfully split groups right there. Furthermore, there were some minor differences\neven within those separate factions.\nThis week would not be easy in a class of more than thirty people. The\nmanual seemed to represent every difficulty we would face in uniting as a\nclass, while simultaneously laying out our freedom. From a little further\naway, Chabashira-sensei watched our confrontation with cold eyes. She\nwasn\u2019t going to appraise her students, though. After all, Class D was a\ncollection of failures; we existed solely to fail. Was that the focus of this\nexercise?\n\u201cHorikita, what do you think?\u201d\n\u201cLike Yukimura-kun says, I would like to get by without using\nunnecessary points. However, I\u2019m not confident that I can make it through\nthe week without satisfactory equipment. That\u2019s just my honest opinion.\nHowever, I think that we ought to challenge ourselves, see how much we can\nendure. What do you say?\u201d\n\u201cI think the same. There\u2019s too much we don\u2019t know,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cHey, look. Did Class A and Class B perhaps already decide what\n", "they\u2019re doing?\u201d\nWe turned toward a girl\u2019s flustered voice. Although only a few minutes\nhad passed, several students had gathered together and were heading into the\nforest. They were probably looking for the best place to set up base camp. It\nwas almost symbolic of their superiority. Meanwhile, Classes C and D still\nlacked cohesion. We couldn\u2019t even get off to a satisfactory start.\n\u201cAh, damn it! This isn\u2019t the time for a long, leisurely chat about toilets!\nI intend to do anything to protect our points. I\u2019ll go look for camp areas and\nspots. Yukimura, Shinohara, and the rest of you, don\u2019t start spending any\npoints.\u201d\n\u201cGot it. We don\u2019t intend to.\u201d\nYou couldn\u2019t call Ike and Yukimura the best of friends, but apparently\nthey could cooperate with a shared goal.\n\u201cWait a minute, Ike-kun. It\u2019s dangerous to go into the forest without a\nplan.\u201d\n\u201cWill staying here and worrying solve anything? It won\u2019t.\u201d\nThe desire to go and the desire to stay clashed. However, Hirata wasn\u2019t\npersuasive enough to stop Ike and the others.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back once I find a spot we can use. Then, after everyone\nmoves there, we can talk. A simple plan, right?\u201d\nDid Sudou and Yamauchi also intend to search for spots? They\ngathered around an impatient Ike.\n\u201cAre you going too, Ayanokouji?\u201d Sudou asked looking me in the eye.\nI casually shook my head.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you three to ever do anything alone. If you get lost, it\u2019ll\nbe trouble.\u201d Hirata seemed to realize that he couldn\u2019t stop this.\n\u201cWe get it. All right, we\u2019ll look for lots of stuff!\u201d\nJust as I\u2019d thought, with no shade to block out the sunlight, it got really\nhot. While we\u2019d spent time sitting here discussing things, we had all grown\ndehydrated.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be really tough to try building our campsite here.\u201d\nThe intense heat made some of our classmates started whining. Hirata\n", "also seemed to realize just how difficult camping on the beach would be. If\nthis were a genuine camp with an umbrella, a beach tent, and plenty of\noptions for swimming in the ocean and protecting ourselves from the sun,\nthat\u2019d be one thing. But our current situation made that difficult.\n\u201cFor the time being, how about we find a place in the shade? We can\ntalk while we move.\u201d Hirata took the initiative and started carrying the tent.\nThe other guys followed suit.\n\u201cBy the way. Did Sudou-kun tidy up the toilet properly?\u201d\nOne of the girls looked anxious as she pointed to the toilet. It was true\nthat Sudou had been empty-handed when he exited after going in to do his\nbusiness. So at the very least, the inside was\u2026\nWe left the toilet under the scorching sun. The inside of the tent\nwould\u2019ve been like a steam bath.\n", "2.2\nWe walked from the beach toward a gigantic forest. One of the boys\nlooked visibly shaken.\n\u201cIs it really okay for us to go in there? We might get really lost. I can\u2019t\nsee into it at all.\u201d\nThat was precisely why we had the roll call rule and the emergency\nbutton installed on our wristwatches. We had to cooperate. If we didn\u2019t work\ntogether, then we\u2019d probably end up panicking and spending our points like\nthey grew on trees.\n\u201cWow, Karuizawa-san. Hirata-kun is really amazing, isn\u2019t he? He takes\non everything that comes his way, even if he dislikes it.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. The other guys are pathetic, so it\u2019s good to just leave\neverything to Hirata-kun, right?\u201d\nHirata, still carrying the tent, walked ahead of Karuizawa\u2019s group, who\nlooked at him with admiration. Incidentally, I was helping carry the luggage,\ntoo. I also carried the simple toilet made out of folded cardboard. I\u2019d\ndetermined that if I didn\u2019t help now, extra work might come my way later.\nFor the time being, I wanted to preemptively give the impression that I was\nhelping.\nHorikita, who was isolated from the other girls, calmly followed the\ngroup from the back. She would occasionally act as though she were going to\nstop, but then immediately started walking again. I slowed down a little bit\nuntil I was walking side by side with her.\n\u201cNot in a good mood?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m depressed. These kinds of things just aren\u2019t for me.\nLife on an island seems primitive, and worst of all, I can\u2019t be alone.\u201d\nEnthusiastically joining in a group effort was far beyond Horikita\u2019s\ncapabilities. I thought it would\u2019ve been good to make an effort to fit in, but it\nwould\u2019ve been pointless to say that to her. I relented.\n\u201cYou know, what you said to me before might end up being true.\u201d\n", "Horikita wore a look of slight amusement.\n\u201cThis test will likely fall outside of my academic abilities. I\u2019d\ndetermined that Ike-kun and Sudou-kun would be hindrances, but they took\nthe initiative to go out searching. I wasn\u2019t able to do anything, because I kept\ndebating what action to take. If they\u2019d started moving quicker, they probably\nwould\u2019ve been able to find something useful.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. More importantly though, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nShe glared. I quickly said \u201cNothing,\u201d and averted my gaze. While\ntalking with Horikita, I felt someone watching my back. Looking over my\nshoulder, I saw Sakura, who was walking way in the back. When she noticed\nthat I\u2019d turned around, she got flustered and looked away.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Horikita asked.\n\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Maybe I was being too nosy. I turned back around.\n\u201cI wonder what the other classes will do. I\u2019ve been curious about their\nmovements. If Classes A and B intend to obtain as many points as possible,\nthen we\u2019ll need to prepare as well. We can\u2019t let the difference between us\nwiden.\u201d Horikita wore a serious expression on her face. In that respect, she\nhad extraordinary resolve. Currently, we were separated from the other\nclasses by a wide margin based solely on our academic abilities. For Horikita,\nwho aimed to reach Class A, this was a fight she absolutely could not afford\nto lose.\n\u201cAiming for the top is tough,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI thought what Chabashira-sensei said back then was a joke, but are\nyou really not at all interested in moving up?\u201d Horikita asked.\nChabashira-sensei had probably said something about that back when\nshe encountered Horikita and me in the guidance room.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not particularly weird or anything, is it? It\u2019s not like Ike and the\nothers are gunning for Class A or anything. If we got an increase in our\nallowance each month, that\u2019d make me happy. If I\u2019m lucky, maybe we can\neven reach Class A.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t speak to others\u2019 true intentions, like Hirata and Karuizawa.\n", "\u201cPeople who come to this school do so to make use of the privileges it\noffers.\u201d Rather than dissatisfied, Horikita appeared puzzled. At the time of\nour enrollment, access to elite universities and job opportunities were\nsupposed to be guaranteed. Many students expected it.\n\u201cWhy did you choose this school?\u201d she asked me.\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t I just say the same thing? To shamelessly make use of the\nprivileges the school offered me.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d This time she sounded blatantly dissatisfied, and regarded me\nwith a sharp side-eye. I thought that Horikita had enrolled here to be at the\nsame school as her older brother. She wasn\u2019t aiming for Class A for her own\nsake, but rather, sought her older brother\u2019s approval. Her ambition differed\nfrom most others.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel good to have someone pry into your past,\u201d she said,\nforestalling me. I\u2019d intended to dig deeper, but it looked like she\u2019d\nimmediately understood my true intentions. I\u2019m trying to understand my past,\nor should I say this person\u2019s past, by thoroughly analyzing and breaking\ndown people.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this: Chabashira-sensei leaked the information. Don\u2019t\nmisunderstand me. All right? Besides, we\u2019re still not friends. Don\u2019t forget\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not really thinking about friendship, anyway.\u201d\nShortly after, Hirata and the others stopped.\n\u201cIf we stop here, there\u2019s foliage blocking the sunlight, and it doesn\u2019t\nseem like we\u2019ll have to worry about anyone hearing us.\u201d\nSome of the boys began teaming up, and it wasn\u2019t long before they had\ntheir own opinions that clashed with Hirata\u2019s.\n\u201cWe ought to be moving, too, not leaving everything to Ike and the\nothers. Don\u2019t you think? If another class captures one of the main spots, the\npoint difference will widen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. We do need to get moving right away, but it\u2019s not\na good idea to neglect our problems and scatter. First of all, we need to\nresolve the toilet question.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying we should just use the toilet that they gave us.\u201d\n", "Yukimura glared at the girls\u2019 group.\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought it over, and I believe we should install one toilet first,\u201d\nHirata said forcefully. Apparently, he was done being pushed around.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just get to decide. Ike also had an opinion.\u201d\n\u201cInstalling a toilet might be a necessary expense. To begin with, we\nhave one simple toilet that our class, which has thirty or more students, isn\u2019t\nused to. I have to wonder if we can really take turns effectively without any\ntrouble?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 If we use it well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic. We have to consider the worst-case scenario. If\neveryone took three minutes to use the restroom, then it would take an hour\nand a half or more for everyone to go. Can that possibly work?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s pointless. Not everyone would need to use the toilet at the\nsame time. The school provided us with just one toilet because it was\nrealistic. We should be able to effectively take turns, right?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. From the beginning, I thought using only one toilet\nwould be impossible. If you reason it out, I think it\u2019s less about refraining\nfrom spending any points, and more that we need to spend our points\neffectively. You should know that, Yukimura-kun. The other classes have\nmost likely come to the same conclusion.\u201d\nNo matter how we used our points, this was a critical junction for\ndetermining whether we\u2019d win or lose. All of the supplies we\u2019d been given\nseemed insufficient. By giving us a tent that only about half our class could\nuse and a small flashlight, the teachers seemed to be suggesting that we\nwould need to use points.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all just speculation on your part. Besides, if the other classes\ndid install the toilets, we\u2019d be twenty points ahead just by doing without\nthem. So that\u2019s precisely why we shouldn\u2019t install one.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that, but it\u2019s unlikely that putting up with a faulty\ntoilet will work out in our favor. It\u2019ll add unnecessary stress and anxiety. I\u2019m\nalso worried about sanitation. Objectively, we should install at least one\ntoilet.\u201d\nIt looked like after taking time to calm down, Hirata had come to a\n", "solid conclusion. It wasn\u2019t just to provoke arguments; he was convinced that\nhe\u2019d get their approval eventually.\n\u201cI think this\u2019ll grant the girls peace of mind.\u201d\nNot even Yukimura could deny Hirata\u2019s impeccable reasoning. Hirata\nunderstood wanting to preserve our points, but he\u2019d also deduced the\ndownsides of a single toilet. Truth be told, our classmates had been given so\nmuch information in one go that they\u2019d overlooked obvious things.\nYukimura, who couldn\u2019t bear being stared at in silence, broke.\n\u201cFine. In that case, let\u2019s install one toilet.\u201d\nIn the end, Yukimura had been beaten. Shinohara, Karuizawa\u2019s group,\nand even Horikita all looked relieved.\n\u201cTeacher. If we wish to install a temporary toilet, can we decide where\nto have it installed?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not on impossible terrain, it can be put anywhere. It\u2019s\nalso possible to have it moved after installation, but it would take some time.\nIt weighs about 100 or more kilos, thus requiring quite a bit of labor.\u201d\nWith one problem resolved, Hirata sighed in relief.\n\u201cNext. We\u2019ve already heard some opinions, but I think we need to\nsearch around and decide where our base camp will be. Where we settle will\nimpact how we consume our points,\u201d said Hirata, obviously trying to head\nanother argument off at the pass.\nWe recruited volunteers, but barely got anyone to help. We ended up\nwith only two guys. Most people weren\u2019t willing to enter such a sprawling\nforest. That was only natural.\n\u201cI wonder if anyone among us has expert survival skills?\u201d said Hirata,\nholding onto a sliver of hope. According to manga clich\u00e9s, there was always\nthat one person you could depend upon in times like these. Hirata checked\nour classmates, but everyone seemed reluctant to step forward. Just then, the\nProfessor, who thus far had silently watched, raised his hand.\n\u201cSince childhood, my father trained me in a particular set of skills. He\ntaught me to survive, even alone in the jungle\u2026is precisely how I would\ndescribe the type of character needed for this situation.\u201d\nEverybody booed. The Professor got flustered and apologized, but it\n", "was too late. We all hated him.\n\u201cUm, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nKushida volunteered herself. Suddenly the boys\u2019 eyes lit up, even\nthough they\u2019d refused to participate before. The formerly reluctant fellows\nstepped forward and volunteered, saying, \u201cMe too, me too!\u201d Some were\nprobably motivated by goodwill for Kushida, while others might\u2019ve been\nembarrassed that a girl had taken the initiative before them.\nI raised my hand as Hirata started counting people.\n\u201cOkay, so eleven people, huh? If we had one more participant, we\ncould make four teams,\u201d Horikita said.\n\u201cAre you going, too?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI have to hang back. But it\u2019s unusual to see you be so proactive.\u201d\n\u201cWell, without a role to fill in the class, you\u2019ll get cut off.\u201d\nJust then, someone raised a rather shy hand. When Hirata saw her, he\nsmiled in relief.\n\u201cThank you, Sakura-san. That makes twelve. Let\u2019s go in four teams of\nthree people. It\u2019s 1:30 right now Regardless of results, I want everyone to\nmeet back here by 3:00.\u201d\nWith that, the twelve volunteers began to form up into teams according\nto their preferences. In the blink of an eye, I became one of the leftovers.\n\u201cN-nice to see you again, Ayanokouji-kun,\u201d said Sakura, who\u2019d also\nbeen overlooked. And then\u2026\n\u201cThe sun certainly is refreshing. My body needs energy.\u201d\nKouenji Rokusuke. That guy was actually going to join our search\nparty. Fortunately, I\u2019d been paired with a free spirit and a quiet girl. With\nthese two, I\u2019d be able to move without any difficulty.\n", "2.3\nThe forest\u2019s verdant, overgrown foliage surrounded us. The further in\nwe went, the thicker it became. It was preferable to the scorching beach, but\nthe damp heat was agonizing. I grabbed the neckline of my shirt and fanned\nmyself to cool down. It was as steamy as water over hot stones.\nAs I thought about it, all I could think was how hot it was. It was way\ntoo hot. Would talking be enough to distract myself from it?\n\u201cKouenji?\u201d\n\u201cAh, so beautiful. As I stand here amongst such vast nature, with an air\nof composure, I really am too beautiful. The pinnacle of beauty!\u201d\nIt was no use. I couldn\u2019t hold a proper conversation with him. There\nwas really only one person I could talk to.\n\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d\nSakura, who was walking a bit behind me, jumped in surprise. Perhaps\nshe hadn\u2019t expected anyone to talk to her.\n\u201cYou raised your hand when Hirata said he wanted one more person,\ndidn\u2019t you? There are lots of things you can do now.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly amazing or anything. It\u2019s really\nnot. Even now, I\u2019m still a little confused.\u201d\nRather than calling her meek, I\u2019d say that Sakura was pensive and bad\nat talking with others. She was probably pretty passive when it came to things\nlike being on a group trip. I\u2019d thought that she would move away from me,\nbut we continued to walk side by side. Hiking from the beach to the forest\nhad put a serious drain on our stamina. Not only was the footing unstable, but\nthe path was on a bit of an incline.\n\u201cSo why did you raise your hand to do something as difficult as\nexploring the forest?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 I felt kind of uncomfortable when everyone else in the\ncrowd got so fired up\u2026\u201d\n", "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how you feel, but even with a small number of\npeople, this won\u2019t be easy.\u201d\nNow I was definitely in this conversation, even if it became unpleasant.\n\u201cBut Ayanokouji-kun, you raised your hand, so\u2026\u201d Sakura raised her\nhead in surprise, growing flustered and making frantic gestures. \u201cTh-that\u2019s\nnot what I mean! It\u2019s just that since there isn\u2019t anyone I can talk to, that\u2019s\nwhy\u2026 That\u2019s what I mean!\u201d\nWith this feverish denial, she hurried forward.\n\u201cH-hey, watch ou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWh\u2014 Aah!\u201d\nAs she turned around to look at me, Sakura\u2019s foot caught on the roots\nof a large tree. Panicked, I tried to grab her, but didn\u2019t make it in time.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh, ouch\u2026\u201d\nFortunately, she\u2019d landed on her butt and hands. It didn\u2019t look like\nanything serious.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get hurt if you\u2019re not careful in the forest. Here, take my hand.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d\nSakura sheepishly reached for me, but then noticed that her hands were\ndirty and quickly withdrew. I didn\u2019t particularly care that her hands were\ndirty, though, so I grabbed her and helped pull her up.\n\u201cS-sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize.\u201d\nI brushed the dirt off Sakura\u2019s hands. This was probably the first time\nany of us had set foot in such a wild forest. I thought we\u2019d be fine so long as\nwe walked in one direction, but I was wrong. First of all, walking in a straight\nline was impossible. There were natural obstacles we couldn\u2019t cross, which\nforcefully changed our path and veered us right or left.\nIf we kept going like this, we\u2019d probably get lost. I had to make sure\nnot to lose sight of Kouenji, who\u2019d been pushing forward relentlessly.\nMeanwhile, Sakura kept silent and absentmindedly stared at the palm of her\n", "right hand.\n\u201cHey, Sakura, come on. Hurry up a bit.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?! A-ah, o-okay.\u201d\nAt my words, Sakura panicked and rushed forward. She was probably\ngoing to trip again.\n\u201cAh, Kouenji-kun sure walks fast, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\nKouenji ventured further and further into the forest without once\nconsidering a girl\u2019s pace. I honestly admired his stamina and his strong legs.\n\u201cIn the first place, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2026\u201d\nWhat in the world was he up to? Was it a coincidence? No, Kouenji\nwalked without hesitation. Even if our team was free to choose the base\ncamp\u2019s location, you\u2019d expect him to be looking around as you went. Kouenji\nwalked straight ahead, almost as if he had another purpose.\nMore than anything else, his progress surprised me. It was possible that\nKouenji wasn\u2019t simply pushing ahead recklessly. Maybe he had a goal in\nmind. However, the problem was that Sakura, in trying to keep up with\nKouenji, was running out of breath.\n\u201cKouenji. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bad idea to rush forward like this?\nWe\u2019ll get lost.\u201d\nI was feeling anxious about both my teammates. Kouenji remained\nwith his back to us and started fixing his hair.\n\u201cI am a perfect human being. I would never foolishly lose my way in a\nforest. If any problem occurs, it would most likely be because you two lost\nsight of me. When that happens, you should give up.\u201d\nJust as I\u2019d expected, he was the sort of guy to declare that he wasn\u2019t\ninterested in anyone other than himself. Was he really this inconsiderate,\ngiven our circumstances?\n\u201cBy the way, I\u2019d like to ask you ordinary people something. Don\u2019t you\nthink this is truly beautiful?\u201d Kouenji flashed an audacious smile, showing us\nhis white teeth.\n", "\u201cWell. I do think that the forest\u2026well, nature\u2026is quite mysterious, or\nrather beautiful.\u201d I tried telling him what I thought, more or less. However,\nKouenji sighed in disappointment.\n\u201cWhat on earth are you talking about? That\u2019s not what I meant. I mean\nhow I, with my perfect physical beauty, shine in such a place. Do you not\nunderstand?\u201d\nSo he wanted me to compliment him on his self-proclaimed \u201cperfect\nphysical beauty.\u201d I see.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably acting a little messed up because of the heat. It\u2019s best\nyou don\u2019t pay him any mind, Sakura.\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah. Kouenji-kun has been acting pretty funny from the start, so\nit\u2019s okay.\u201d\nWow. That may have been the truth, but it was unexpectedly harsh.\nAnyway, Kouenji, seemingly satisfied with his own beauty, started walking\nagain. From that point onward, I decided not to get my hopes up with regards\nto our third teammate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. Even if something happened in a forest like\nthis, there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Kouenji?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this a natural forest. The probability of getting lost\nduring the day is extremely low. It\u2019s precisely for that reason that I\u2019m a little\ncurious.\u201d\nWith those mysterious words, Kouenji continued quickly forward,\nseemingly having lost interest in us. He was so fast that Sakura couldn\u2019t keep\nup with him.\n\u201cHey!\u201d I called.\n\u201cU-um, I\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ll do my best to follow.\u201d\nEven though she was all sweaty, Sakura tried to give a small fist pump.\nShe still looked uncertain, like she was going to trip and fall, but I supposed\nthat she\u2019d hardened her resolve to do her best. Kouenji, clearly taking no\nnotice of Sakura\u2019s efforts, got further and further ahead. I\u2019d thought he\u2019d\nkeep going until we passed through the forest, but he suddenly stopped.\nTurning, he flashed another audacious smile while stroking his hair.\n", "\u201cMay I ask you common folk another question?\u201d\nBefore we could reply, Kouenji continued.\n\u201cWhat do you think of this place? What do you see when you look\naround?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Wh-what does he mean? Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d\nIn the face of Kouenji\u2019s sharp gaze, Sakura hid behind my back. What\ndid I think about this place? I tried scanning my surroundings. While I did so,\nSakura also looked around. However, nothing seemed especially notable. It\nwas just forest. What in the world was he trying to get at?\n\u201cGood. I understand. Please, do not worry. Common folk are simple,\nafter all.\u201d\nWhen Kouenji realized that he wasn\u2019t going to get the answer he\nwanted, he walked quickly forward into the forest again.\n\u201cWhat? Did something change?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\nIf you honestly believed everything Kouenji said to you, you\u2019d go mad.\nHe was the sort of man who would play any number of games. However, it\nwas possible we were missing something. In any case, we didn\u2019t have the\ntime to search at our leisure.\n\u201cSakura, do you have a handkerchief with you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah. This okay?\u201d\nJust as I\u2019d expect of a girl, she seemed to be prepared.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all right with you, could I borrow it? It might get a little dirty,\nthough.\u201d\n\u201cSure, that\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d replied Sakura, without any hint of\nobjection. She handed me her handkerchief.\nI tied it to a nearby tree branch, one that didn\u2019t seem like it would break\neasily. It would act as a sort of marker for us later on.\n\u201cAh, we\u2019re going to lose sight of Kouenji-kun. Let\u2019s hurry,\nAyanokouji-kun.\u201d\nSakura was flustered, and increasingly exhausted. It seemed likely she\n", "was about to trip and fall. After all, she was probably close to her physical\nlimits. Even if she forced herself onward, she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up.\n\u201cSorry, but this is a bit too physically demanding. Do you mind if we\nslow down?\u201d\nWith that, I slowed my pace. That way, Sakura wouldn\u2019t feel like the\nproblem. She probably saw through my ploy, but I didn\u2019t mind. It wasn\u2019t as\nthough she could call me out on it. By this point, we\u2019d lost sight of Kouenji.\nFar ahead, I could occasionally make out the rustle of grass and the footsteps\non the earth.\n\u201cWow, he\u2019s a man of many talents. Kouenji, I mean.\u201d\nHe possessed a brilliant mind and outstanding physical ability, which\nhe\u2019d perfectly adapted to the forest without hesitation. If only he had a\npersonality like Hirata\u2019s, he would be a perfect superhuman.\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\nSakura seemed to have been silently looking over at something for\nsome time. I was curious, but she didn\u2019t bring it up, and the two of us\ncontinued our search.\n\u201cIt would be great if we secured some drinking water. Or maybe a\nplace where we could take shelter.\u201d\nSince I had nothing to do, I tried making light conversation. If we\nmanaged to secure a spot that made it possible to save points, our lives would\nget much easier.\n\u201cOh yeah. I suppose that two tents probably won\u2019t be enough\u2026 But I\ncan\u2019t find anything.\u201d\nNo matter how much I tried or how far we walked, I couldn\u2019t seem to\nfind even one man-made object. Well, while I say we walked far, we\u2019d only\nreally covered a fraction of one percent of the island. The school probably\nwouldn\u2019t be kind enough to go easy on us. After tromping through wild\nterrain, a pathway appeared before us.\n\u201cThis is a path, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cLooks like it.\u201d\nIn the middle of a forest on an uninhabited island, someone had created\n", "a path. It wasn\u2019t paved or anything, of course, but trees had been chopped\ndown and the path was well-trod. If the school had prepared this, then\nperhaps a spot lay further ahead. Sakura and I pressed onward.\n\u201cWow. Amazing!\u201d\nSoon we arrived at what appeared to be a large hole in the\nmountainside: an entrance into a cave. At first glance it appeared to be a\nnatural cave, but upon closer inspection the inside appeared properly\nreinforced. Perhaps the hole itself had been created by human hands.\n\u201cCould this possibly be\u2026a spot?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nSince ancient times, caves have provided outstanding dwellings for\npeople. If this place had been designated as a spot, there should have been\nproof. I tried to approach the cave to check, but then saw some guy coming\nout of it. I immediately grabbed Sakura\u2019s arm and pulled her to hide in the\nshade. I felt bad, but I didn\u2019t understand the situation. Hopefully she\u2019d\nforgive me.\nThe person stopped at the entrance, and quietly looked to the\nsouthwest. He stood there for a minute or two. He\u2019d wasted absolutely no\ntime in securing this spot. It seemed like he\u2019d gone straight to this cave\nwithout any hesitation. That aside, the man was tightly holding onto what\nlooked to be some kind of card. Then, we heard a voice coming from inside\nthe cave. Panicked, I hid my face.\n\u201cIn a cave this size, we should have enough room for two tents,\nKatsuragi-san. We sure were lucky. We secured a spot really quickly.\u201d\nI listened carefully, trying to grasp the situation.\n\u201cLuck? What are you talking about? I figured that there was a cave\nhere even before we landed. Finding it was inevitable. Be mindful of what\nyou say and do. We don\u2019t know if anyone is out there listening to us. As the\nleader, I have a responsibility. Be sure you don\u2019t make even the slightest\nmistake.\u201d\n\u201cS-sorry. But when you say \u2018since before we landed\u2019, what do you\nmean?\u201d\n\u201cBefore the ship docked at the pier, it had already taken a trip around\n", "the island as a detour for some reason. That was probably a deliberate move\nby the school to give the students some hints. From the ship\u2019s deck, I noticed\na path that cut through the forest. All I had to do was take the shortest route\nfrom the pier after we\u2019d landed to the path.\u201d\n\u201cB-but it might\u2019ve been just a chance for us to enjoy the scenery.\u201d\n\u201cThat was far too long of a roundabout for sightseeing. Besides, the\nannouncement was strange, too.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice anything at all, and yet\u2026 Katsuragi-san, you managed\nto see the school\u2019s true intentions. Because of that, you understood there was\na cave here. Just as we\u2019d expect from you!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the next one, Yahiko. It\u2019s pointless to linger here after\nwe\u2019ve claimed the spot. There\u2019s a path to two other places that I noticed from\nthe ship. There should be some kind of facility up ahead.\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah! If we leave it like this, Sakayanagi will have no choice but to\nbe quiet!\u201d\n\u201cIf you only look straight ahead, you might overlook things.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that, but isn\u2019t it enough just to be cautious of Class B? I\nmean, Class D is just an assortment of failures, right? They\u2019re defective.\nConsidering the point difference, it\u2019s probably fine to ignore them, right?\u201d\nI\u2019d heard talk like that on the ship earlier\u2014that Class D was basically\nbeyond Class A\u2019s consideration. They treated us like pebbles in their path.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough chit-chat. Let\u2019s go, Yahiko.\u201d\nI waited until I could no longer hear their voices or footsteps, and then\nwaited two minutes more.\n\u201cDid they go?\u201d Sakura whispered.\nI peeked out to check, but I didn\u2019t see them. As I caught my breath, I\nnoticed that my hands had grown comparatively warmer. I must\u2019ve kept hold\nof Sakura\u2019s hands after I grabbed her in a panic.\n\u201cSorry, Sakura. Sakura?\u201d\n\u201cWhaa?!\u201d\nSakura was all right, though for some reason she seemed almost\ncomatose.\n", "\u201cA-are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI-I-I-I\u2019m o-o-okay\u2026\u201d\nHer face turned so red I was afraid steam was going to start rising from\nher body. She sat weakly right down. Perhaps I\u2019d held onto her more\nforcefully than I thought.\n\u201cAh, ah, ah\u2026 I-I thought I was going to die. My heart stopped\u2026\u201d\nHopefully that was an exaggeration. Sakura\u2019s breathing stabilized as\nshe adjusted her glasses.\n\u201cThose two guys seemed like they were from Class A, based on what\nthey were saying.\u201d\nI worried about abandoning this place. With no one here keeping\nwatch, this spot could be intercepted. After waiting for Sakura\u2019s strength to\nreturn, we approached the cave entrance once again. Those two had left\nwithout any hesitation\u2026\nInside the cave, some kind of terminal device with a monitor was\nembedded into the wall. The words \u201cClass A\u201d were displayed on the screen,\nalong with a countdown timer that showed seven hours and 55 minutes\nremaining. Was this the proof that they owned this spot? We couldn\u2019t do\nanything to interfere until the countdown reached zero, and we couldn\u2019t force\nour way in.\nThat\u2019s why those two had left this place without worry. But that wasn\u2019t\nthe only problem. As long as the rights of ownership weren\u2019t snatched by\nanother class, Class A would keep acquiring one point every eight hours.\nAlthough they\u2019d lost thirty points because of one student\u2019s illness, they were\nearning it back. Besides, that Katsuragi guy seemed to have determined there\nwere a few other facilities. If a spot happened to have food and water, could\nthey widen the gap between the other classes?\n\u201cHe said he\u2019d noticed something even before we landed on the\nisland\u2026\u201d\nThey\u2019d memorized the island\u2019s topography and used that to find a spot.\nBrilliant. I supposed that Class A students saw the world differently.\nHowever, that way of thinking led to some depressing conclusions.\n\u201cH-hey, Ayanokouji-kun. Could that person from before have been\u2026\n", "the leader?\u201d\nShe was right. This incident had proved to be a fatal mistake. Class A\nhad to use their key card in order to maintain rights of exclusive ownership to\nthe cave. They had clearly made their leader known to us. Of course, he\nprobably hadn\u2019t considered that someone from another class could be\nwatching him, but that had been careless of them. I considered investigating\nthe entire cave, but there was no sign of anyone hiding.\n\u201cWh-wh-what should we do? We just found out an incredible secret!\u201d\nsaid Sakura. She sounded impatient, perhaps because she was excited to have\ndelivered a huge blow to Class A.\n\u201cI\u2019ll report it to Hirata later.\u201d\nSakura appeared relieved. She had poor communication skills, and by\ntaking that responsibility, I\u2019d helped her.\n", "2.4\nThings started to move when we returned to Hirata and the others,\nwho hadn\u2019t achieved any results. The Idiot Trio seemed to be in surprisingly\nhigh spirits, and were speaking rather enthusiastically to Hirata about\nsomething.\n\u201cA river, a river! What an incredible feeling! And there was some kind\nof mechanism installed around there! It could be a gadget to get right of\npossession, or whatever! It\u2019s only a ten-minute walk from here, so let\u2019s\nhurry!\u201d\nIt seemed like Ike and his group had made some headway, and wanted\nto stand guard so another class wouldn\u2019t snatch the spot.\n\u201cThis is huge. If we can secure the river, our situation might take a turn\nfor the better.\u201d\nIt seemed we\u2019d decided on the base camp\u2019s location. Of course, it\nwould depend on the terrain and environment, but this likely was going to be\nour first step forward.\n\u201cBut there are two teams that still haven\u2019t returned. Someone should\nwait for them, right?\u201d\nIt was a little before three o\u2019clock. If they hadn\u2019t returned by the\nappointed time, there was a good chance they were lost in the forest.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hirata. Kouenji isn\u2019t back yet, either. We got split up.\u201d\n\u201cAh, Kouenji-kun actually came back a little while ago. He left to go\nswimming.\u201d\nSo he hadn\u2019t gotten lost, but had instead slipped away. I should have\nexpected it.\n\u201cSplit up? Didn\u2019t you take the lead?\u201d Horikita asked with a sigh, as\neveryone began moving toward the river.\n\u201cI can\u2019t control that guy. You know that.\u201d\nHad he been trying to start trouble? Kouenji had run off at a quick\npace, suggesting that he was already familiar with the forest.\n", "\u201cI see. You can\u2019t really complain about his abilities, though the same\ncan\u2019t be said of his personality.\u201d\n\u201cJust like you.\u201d\n\u201cDid you say something?\u201d she growled.\n\u201cN-nope, I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nOur class was rife with personality issues, myself included. Poor\nHirata.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHorikita suddenly turned and looked behind her, staring sharply at\nSakura.\n\u201cEh?!\u201d\n\u201cWere you looking at me just now?\u201d Horikita asked.\n\u201cI-I-I-I wasn\u2019t looking at anything!\u201d\nSakura, flustered, ran off to put some distance between us.\n\u201cDon\u2019t scare her like that. You can be a monster, Horikita.\u201d\n\u201cSo I should freely let her poke around and misconstrue things?\u201d\n\u201cThere! We found the spot! It\u2019s amazing!\u201d\nWe finally arrived at Ike\u2019s chosen land. Inside the cave, the mechanism\nhad been embedded into the wall, but here at the river\u2019s edge, the equipment\nwas installed on an unnaturally placed boulder. Hirata and his team started\nsetting up the tents and other necessities for camp near the river.\n\u201cOkay. The water is beautiful, and there\u2019s shade that blocks the\nsunlight. The terrain is level. This might be the ideal place for our base camp\nhere. Amazing, Ike-kun!\u201d Hirata said.\n\u201cHeh heh heh, I know, right?\u201d\nThe river was about ten meters wide, and the water flowed gently. It\nwas amazing. Deep forests and sandy roads surrounded the river, but this\nplace looked as if it had been maintained. I doubted this location was so\nnaturally perfect. Our school had likely set it up for this purpose.\n\u201cSo how do we show that this is ours now?\u201d\n", "The river was pretty wide, and flowed downstream for quite a ways. At\nfirst glance, our flat piece of land was surrounded on all sides by the trees.\nThere may not have been another favorable location like this, but it did seem\nlike this was a natural entranceway to the area. Perhaps following the river\nmight lead you here. Or was use of the river a privilege only given to those\noccupying this space?\nI was a little concerned as I walked along the river toward the forest.\nHorikita tagged along for some reason.\n\u201cThe school seems to know about this area, too. It looks like we\u2019re the\nonly ones who can use the river.\u201d\nIn the middle of the path, a signboard was affixed to a tree. A message\nread that the river was a designated spot, and that unauthorized use was\nprohibited. After casually looking about, we returned to the others.\n\u201cSo if we make this spot our base camp, the problem is whether or not\nwe can occupy it.\u201d\n\u201cWe already decided that this would be it! If we don\u2019t choose this spot,\nwhat\u2019ll we do?\u201d\n\u201cWe have other choices. If we claim this place, there are obvious\nmerits; we can monopolize the river, for one. Also, we can gain some points\nby holding this area. However, that requires us to update it once every eight\nhours, and since the designated leader is the only one who can handle that\noperation, it\u2019ll be serious trouble if he or she is seen. We still don\u2019t know if\nsomeone might be watching.\u201d\nWe were surrounded by forest on all sides. We couldn\u2019t notice a spy in\nthe brushwood.\n\u201cHmm, so if we stay hidden and protected, it\u2019ll be fine, right? We can\nkeep the area surrounded.\u201d\nAlthough there were risks, Ike was correct. If we made our base camp\nin this area, there was no way to pin us down. If students from another class\ntook this place, it would become impossible to use the river. Both guys and\ngirls agreed with Ike on this. I think that Hirata had wanted to agree anyway,\nbut being a font of neutrality, he\u2019d wanted to collect a lot of opinions.\nIt was true that obtaining the rights of exclusive possession was\n", "something of a double-edged sword, with both risks and rewards. However,\nas with Class A occupying the cave, it was possible for the class to act\ntogether to protect ourselves. It went without saying that Classes B and C\nwould most likely have done the same thing. In other words, it was an\nacceptable risk.\n\u201cOkay. Well, the next question is, who will be the leader?\u201d\nMore than whether we\u2019d take possession, the leader was key. A\nmistake here could prove fatal. While everyone wanted to avoid a role with\nsuch important responsibilities, Kushida asked everyone to form a circle.\n\u201cI thought a lot of things over. I have to say, Hirata-san and\nKaruizawa-san just stand out too much, like it or not. However, a leader\u2019s no\ngood unless that person has a sense of responsibility, right? I think that\nHorikita-san meets that criteria. But, what do you think?\u201d\nHorikita looked like she hadn\u2019t expected such a recommendation, but\nher expression didn\u2019t change. I\u2019d wondered if she were perhaps the least risky\nchoice, since she was so desperate to reach Class A. That was crucial.\nI calmly observed everyone\u2019s reactions.\n\u201cI agree with Kushida-san. That is to say, I also think that Horikita-san\nwould be a good leader. So long as Horikita-san is okay with it, then I think\nit\u2019d be good for her to take over. What do you think?\u201d Hirata said.\nWith everyone\u2019s eyes fixed on her, it didn\u2019t appear that Horikita was\ngoing to refuse.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do it though, right? Don\u2019t make her do it. I can do\nit in her place.\u201d\nSudou stepped forward, seemingly to protect Horikita\u2019s wishes.\nHowever, Horikita then calmly accepted the decision, almost as if Sudou\u2019s\nremarks had triggered her to do so.\n\u201cI understand. I accept.\u201d\nPersonally, I was relieved that someone like Sudou or Ike wasn\u2019t the\nleader. Hirata immediately went over to Chabashira-sensei to pass on\nHorikita\u2019s name. Before long, he returned with a card and entrusted it to\nHorikita. Taking into consideration the possibility that we were being\nwatched, we had everyone touch the device without it activating. This was to\n", "camouflage the leader, so a spy wouldn\u2019t know who he or she was.\n\u201cOkay, so we\u2019ve resolved the problems of bathing and drinking water!\nRight?\u201d Ike\u2019s eyes sparked brilliantly as he dreamed of saving points.\n\u201cHuh? Drink from the river? Are you insane?\u201d\nApparently Ike intended to use this as an all-purpose river. However,\nShinohara and the other girls did not appear to agree, glancing at the river in\ndisgust.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019d be great for swimming, but\u2026to drink from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the heck? It\u2019s perfectly fine. The water\u2019s clean and pure, right?\u201d\nIke said.\n\u201cWell, yeah. It certainly seems like you can drink it, but\u2026\u201d\nShinohara tugged on Hirata\u2019s sleeve, asking her champion to defend\nthem against Ike\u2019s frugality.\n\u201cHey, Hirata-kun. Is it really okay? It\u2019s not normal to drink from a\nriver, is it?\u201d\nSeveral uneasy girls gathered around Hirata to ask his advice. They\nshook their heads, as if signaling that such a thing was impossible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can drink from that.\u201d\nIke, visibly frustrated, had had enough. \u201cReally? Look how inviting the\nwater is. How it flows. It\u2019s like perfectly natural spring water!\u201d\nEven though the water didn\u2019t look muddy or cloudy, the girls were not\nthe only ones to hesitate. The boys also looked unsure.\n\u201cWhat the heck, you guys? What\u2019s wrong with you? There\u2019s no reason\nnot to use the river after going through all the trouble of finding it.\u201d\n\u201cThen you drink it, as an experiment.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Well, fine, whatever\u2026\u201d\nPressured, Ike scooped up some water with his hands and drank.\n\u201cAh! Whew, that\u2019s ice cold. It feels great! It\u2019s damn good!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a major turn off. No way, no way! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m\ndrinking that. Gross!\u201d\n", "\u201cHuh?! You\u2019re the one who told me to drink it, Shinohara!\u201d\n\u201cNo way! Ugh, I hate barbarians like you most of all, god!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\nThe two of them exchanged glares hot enough to send sparks flying.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that hatred is close to love. Could that be true with these\ntwo?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026really doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.\u201d\nWith the toilet resolved, the next issue was drinking water. Even with\nthe river, it didn\u2019t appear as though everything had been settled.\n\u201cFor the time being, let\u2019s table the water issue. It\u2019s only going to be\npainful if you fight,\u201d said Hirata, apparently desperate for peace.\nOur problems would likely grow if we delayed things, but no one was\nreally going to object to Hirata. Or so I thought, until a certain guy butted into\nthe conversation.\n\u201cShinohara, don\u2019t complain. We gotta cooperate on this test.\u201d\nThat came from our class\u2019 number one problem child, Sudou, who\nchided Shinohara in an unusually calm tone.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t make me laugh. Cooperate? That\u2019s funny coming from you,\nSudou-kun.\u201d\nShinohara laughed, seizing at her stomach as if it hurt. It was only\nnatural she\u2019d poke fun at Sudou. Since Sudou had started at our school, he\u2019d\nrepeatedly caused problems for our class. He was far from being a model of\ncooperativeness, though in a different way from Horikita. It seemed that\nSudou himself was aware of this.\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve caused trouble for the class. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. If\nyou keep antagonizing people with trivial crap, eventually it\u2019s gonna come\nback to bite you, er, you know where.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re saying that because you don\u2019t want to use any points,\nSudou-kun.\u201d\n\u201cNo one said anything about that. Kanji, calm down a little. If someone\nsuddenly told you to drink from the river, you\u2019d put up some resistance,\nright? I would. Hey, if we boil the water, it\u2019ll become sterilized, right? So\n", "right now, why don\u2019t we try that?\u201d\n\u201cBoiling? This isn\u2019t some kind of chemistry experiment. Stop coming\nup with such unexpectedly thoughtful suggestions!\u201d\nShinohara was being rather aggressive toward Sudou, as if she were\nprepared to fight against anyone who displeased her. Hirata once again tried\nto calm everyone down as the fight got heated.\n\u201cLet\u2019s try breaking apart for a bit. We still have some time. It\u2019s not\nnecessary to decide things in a panic.\u201d\nCalmed by those words, Shinohara fell silent and withdrew. Shortly\nafterward, Hirata went over to Chabashira-sensei to request the temporary\ntoilet. Ike, unable to contain his anger at Shinohara, just kept biting his lip in\nfrustration.\n\u201cDamn it! What the hell is Shinohara\u2019s deal? It\u2019s like she won\u2019t even\ntry.\u201d\nUpset, Ike skipped a pebble across the river. He got five or six good\nskips before it effortlessly hit the other bank. For an accident, it was still\nbeautiful. If I tried to do that, it probably wouldn\u2019t have gone so well.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re surprisingly really good at outdoorsy stuff.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? Oh, I wouldn\u2019t really say that. It\u2019s just that I used to go\ncamping together with my family back when I was little. I\u2019m not opposed to\ndrinking river water. I can tell if the water source is clean just by looking.\u201d\nIke sounded honest rather than boastful.\n\u201cWell then, wouldn\u2019t it have been a good idea to tell us about your\ncamping experience from the beginning? If you\u2019d gained people\u2019s trust,\nthings might\u2019ve gone more smoothly.\u201d\nYou had to give an explanation for your actions. Especially since this\nwasn\u2019t something that could be observed easily, unlike a test score.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d been in the Boy Scouts, I\u2019d have legitimate bragging rights. But\njust going camping isn\u2019t anything to brag about. Even if I said anything, it\nwould\u2019ve been pointless, anyway.\u201d\nHe\u2019d apparently gotten rather discouraged after being so harshly\ncriticized by the girls. For Ike, who normally only cared about being\n", "attractive to the ladies, that had to hurt. However, if he\u2019d only changed the\nway he handled things, the situation might\u2019ve gone differently.\nBut then\u2026Ike said something unusual.\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s everyone\u2019s first time camping out. I thought that\neveryone had at least a little experience. I guess the stuff I said was probably\na little unreasonable.\u201d\nHe\u2019d realized he made a mistake. That was the first time Ike had ever\nexpressed regret.\n\u201cSorry. I gotta think of how to take care of this. I\u2019m gonna go for a\nswim in the river.\u201d\nIke stood and turned his back to me. I thought that was probably fine\nfor now. The heat had likely muddled his head, and searching around had\nprobably tired him out.\n\u201cAyanokouji-kun. Can you follow him?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d\nHorikita stood next to me. After Ike left, she spoke.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that his knowledge will prove useful. He might be\ninstrumental to Class D. In addition to his outdoor knowledge, he seems to\nknow his way around the forest. Also, since Kouenji-kun is basically useless,\nthe class will need Ike to pull them forward.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think you can persuade him yourself?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Persuade him? You think I can?\u201d She sounded nonplussed,\nalmost as if she couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d asked her such a thing.\nEven though she had smugly appealed for me to handle something she\ncouldn\u2019t\u2026she had a point. In truth, Horikita\u2019s interpersonal skills were well\nbelow that of an average person.\n\u201cI\u2019m relying on you because I know I can\u2019t do it. Can I count on you?\u201d\n\u201cWell sure, I guess. You don\u2019t have anyone else to rely on but me?\u201d\nEven if I wasn\u2019t great in this area, I was certainly better than no option\nat all.\n\u201cI suppose it must be relaxing to be unreliable and underachieving.\n", "Isn\u2019t it, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d\nAmazing that she could so brazenly ask a favor while being so\ncondescending.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him, but leave the timing to me.\u201d\n\u201cFine. I\u2019m not entirely certain if now is the best time anyway.\u201d\nWe left it at that, with my acceptance and the realization we had\nnothing left to say to one another. I wondered if this week would show\nHorikita how difficult it was to live life as a hermit. Alone, she was\namazing\u2026but only alone.\nIn an academic setting, she could quietly continue her race to the top\nwithout relying on anyone. But this test proved that there were some things\nyou couldn\u2019t do alone. Horikita now probably felt powerless for the first\ntime. It was probably why she\u2019d come to rely on me so quickly, at this early\nstage. If you didn\u2019t have any friends, you\u2019d have no one to talk to. Without\ncommunication, there could be no cooperation or trust. An academically\nbrilliant girl was less useful than a normal student in a situation like this.\n\u201cThe school probably factored that into their calculations, too,\u201d I\nmuttered.\nThis week would test Horikita Suzune\u2019s limits, and show her at her\nworst. The school had made her isolated life impossible.\n", "2.5\nFurther away, two tents were set up next to each other. Shinohara and\nthe girls had decided that they would occupy both tents. In other words, that\nmeant that the boys would have to completely rough it by sleeping out in the\nopen. The majority of our classmates had likely never slept outdoors before\nin their lives. Fortunately, because it was summer, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d catch a\ncold, but we were definitely going to have a hard time.\nGetting mosquito bites on our arms and legs was bound to become\nannoying, and once night fell our visibility would get worse. The grass was\ncrawling with all kinds of unfamiliar insects, which was just creepy. Being a\ncity kid myself, I was pretty disgusted, and spending an entire week sleeping\nrough seemed impossible. That said, people like Ike, who absolutely opposed\nspending points as much as possible, were moving to take action.\nSeveral boys tried using pulled grass as a substitute for bedsheets, and\ntalked about whether or not they could cut down some trees. It was nice that\nthey were trying to figure things out; I just prayed that they wouldn\u2019t do\nanything unreasonable. Hirata came over to us after setting up the girls\u2019 tents,\nwiping the sweat from his forehead.\n\u201cExcuse me, Ayanokouji-kun? Can I talk to you for a minute? I have\nsomething I wanted to ask.\u201d\nHe appeared sheepish and apologetic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get scary tonight with just a flashlight. Whether we use\npoints or not, securing some light is necessary. However, I can\u2019t force you to\nagree, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d\nIt was certainly true that I\u2019d rather not go through the night without any\nsource of illumination. It\u2019d make going to the toilet a nightmare. When I\nasked what we should do, Hirata thought about it, and then answered.\n\u201cWe could make a bonfire. I was hoping you\u2019d collect branches.\u201d\nApparently I\u2019d been singled out as the most qualified guy for this task,\nsomehow.\n\u201cWell. I\u2019ll pick up ones that look good.\u201d\n", "\u201cThank you! Ah, but, it\u2019s dangerous to do it alone. I think you should\ninvite someone else to come along.\u201d\nFair point. I set out to look for a partner. Horikita was standing\ncompletely still, gazing up at the sky. She must have noticed that I was\nlooking at her, because she came over.\n\u201cYou\u2019re normally incredibly uncooperative, but you\u2019re being rather\ngenerous by going along with his favor,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you just ask me for a favor, too? Besides, this is just something\nto help Hirata. The work isn\u2019t really a big deal or anything. Just picking up\nbranches.\u201d\nSome of the students voluntarily acted to help the class. One\u2019s position\nwithin the caste system changed depending on whether or not you took\ninitiative.\n\u201cFor someone like Hirata, who\u2019s positioned as the center of the class,\nto rely upon you is kind of pathetic.\u201d\n\u201cClass D\u2019s real leaders are Hirata and Karuizawa, for better or worse.\nNo one else has their ability to rally others. No one else is as qualified.\u201d\nHorikita appeared quite serious. She certainly had the competence and\nskills to rally the class. However, her charisma and leadership were sorely\nlacking, to the extent that I didn\u2019t even think those two qualities existed\nwithin her. Kushida probably couldn\u2019t stand all the harsh words that erupted\nwhen the class got into an argument, but she said she\u2019d do her best. Even\nnow, she was probably off somewhere putting forth all her effort into\nwhatever she was doing.\n\u201cSo how about working as Hirata\u2019s assistant? For yourself, rather than\nfor the class.\u201d\n\u201cMe, his assistant? Don\u2019t joke around. I\u2019d rather dance with a\nmongoose.\u201d\n\u201cDance with a mongoose?\u201d\nWhatever that expression meant, it was probably an insult to Hirata.\nNo, not probably. It was definitely an insult.\n\u201cI\u2019m joking. Well, his differences from a mongoose aside, there\u2019s\nnothing I can do to help. If there were a clear enemy and a goal, I might be of\n", "use. Besides, I\u2019m still unsure whether or not we should use points, or even to\nwhat extent we should use them.\u201d\nWith that, we quietly split up. Horikita went into the tent. For the time\nbeing, I needed a congenial partner who would go with me. Hunting through\nthe available guys, I saw Sudou just staring up at the sky while standing by\nthe river\u2019s edge. He helped Ike earlier. Maybe he\u2019d become a reliable guy.\nHe\u2019d probably help a friend in need.\n\u201cHey, Sudou. I\u2019m going to collect branches for a bonfire. Want to\ncome?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? If it\u2019s a hassle, I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d\nHe looked as if he had no intention of helping. But since I wasn\u2019t going\nto find anyone else, I persisted.\n\u201cProbably won\u2019t be a hassle. I\u2019m just going to collect them from\nnearby.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds exactly like a hassle. Sorry. I\u2019m gonna go swimming.\u201d\nSudou stood, grabbed the bag next to him, and headed for the water.\n\u201cWell. Guess that\u2019s that.\u201d\nI saw Yamauchi chatting up some girls near the tents, and decided to\ntry again.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m going to get some branches for a bonfire. Could you help\nme?\u201d\n\u201cEh, sounds like work. Look, I found a good spot with Kanji, right?\nWe\u2019re pretty beat. Sorry, but I gotta pass.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Got it.\u201d\nThere was nothing I could say to that. Well, I was in trouble. All of my\npossibilities had been shot down. Horikita wasn\u2019t exactly in any state to help\nright now, and Kushida was off somewhere with the girls\u2019 team.\n\u201cGuess I\u2019m alone in the end, huh?\u201d\nYamauchi continued happily chatting with the girls, and didn\u2019t show\nany support. Just as I resolved to head into the forest by myself, Sakura\nstepped forward, like she\u2019d been waiting for her chance.\n\u201cUm\u2026 I-Is it okay if I\u2026go with you?\u201d\n", "Apparently she\u2019d been listening to my conversation.\n\u201cHuh? Oh, I\u2019m really grateful, but are you sure? I mean, you look\npretty tired. Maybe it would be better for you to rest.\u201d\nSakura had already searched the woods with me. I didn\u2019t want to force\nher.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay. Besides, if I stay here, well\u2026it\u2019ll be\u2026a little\nuncomfortable.\u201d\nShe glanced at the other girls. If Sakura was anything like me, she\nprobably had a really hard time engaging with others.\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nBecause Kouenji wasn\u2019t with us, I could match Sakura\u2019s pace.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nJust as we were heading into the forest, Yamauchi called out and\nrushed toward us.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you after all!\u201d\nApparently he\u2019d changed his mind.\n\u201cUh. Are you sure?\u201d\n\u201cHey, come on now. I mean, you gotta help a friend in need. Right,\nSakura?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 Y-yeah.\u201d\nSakura shied away behind my back and nodded. She hadn\u2019t really ever\ntalked with Yamauchi before. Maybe this\u2019d be a good friend-making\nopportunity for her.\n", "2.6\nWe decided to collect branches from nearby so we didn\u2019t stray too\nfar from base camp. After a short walk, the three of us spread out to pick up\nbranches.\n\u201cH-hey, Ayanokouji. I got something that I want you to keep just\nbetween us,\u201d Yamauchi whispered. He was standing close to me, a few\nbranches in hand.\n\u201cI think\u2026I\u2019m gonna go for Sakura.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, don\u2019t you think Kushida-chan\u2019s out of my league? Her\ncommunication skills are top-notch. I\u2019m thinking of giving up on her as my\nmain target. Compared to Kushida, it\u2019s like, Sakura\u2019s just not good with\npeople, or like, she doesn\u2019t know how to deal with guys, you know? To be\nperfectly honest, I was thinking about seeing how far I could go on this trip. I\nthink she might fall for a guy who\u2019s gentle and attentive. I mean, until I at\nleast get a kiss or something. Yeah, seriously. I think Sakura\u2019s fine. No,\nSakura\u2019s great.\u201d\n\u201cGreat? You haven\u2019t hung around Sakura before now. Isn\u2019t this really\nsudden?\u201d\n\u201cNah, man. Like, I actually regret not seeing it before, you know?\nShe\u2019s plain, so she didn\u2019t catch my eye at first, but she\u2019s actually super cute.\nAnd an idol? Plus, her boobs are incredible. Even when she changes into\njerseys, you can still see \u2019em. I can\u2019t help noticing.\u201d\nHe started rubbing his hands together and chuckling.\nApparently this explained his sudden interest in helping. Sakura was\nbeing treated as a backup plan after he gave up on his favorite, Kushida. I\ncouldn\u2019t imagine Sakura would be pleased to hear that. I\u2019d hoped that maybe\nYamauchi had come to like Sakura for real.\n\u201cSo please, help me out. For example, leave me alone with Sakura for a\nwhile.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that counts as helping you\u2026\u201d\n", "\u201cWhat? Wait, you\u2019re not after Sakura too, are you? Those boobies!\u201d\nWhy did so many guys look at things in such simplistic, nasty way? It\u2019s\nnot that I didn\u2019t understand his desires. I mean, woman\u2019s breasts were\nattractive, and there was a biological explanation for why guys liked them.\nNormally, I wouldn\u2019t mind helping him out. But Sakura wasn\u2019t like Kushida.\nShe was unused to dealing with guys. It would\u2019ve been a different story if\nhe\u2019d wanted to become her friend, but I couldn\u2019t leave her alone with some\nguy who only wanted to get into her pants. Besides, if Yamauchi got carried\naway, Sakura wouldn\u2019t know how to resist.\n\u201cGive it up for now. I\u2019ll help you when you get to know Sakura better.\nBesides, I\u2019d like to go back and start the bonfire while it\u2019s still early. All\nright?\u201d\nYamauchi slumped his shoulders in disappointment, but his spirits\nrecovered immediately.\n\u201cJeez, you\u2019re stiff. Well, fine. You have Horikita anyway, Ayanokouji.\nYou don\u2019t have to worry, right?\u201d\nSince when did I have Horikita?\n\u201cCome on, just start picking up branches. I\u2019ll head over here.\u201d\nWith that, he shoved his branches at me. I dropped a few, and they\nrolled across the ground. Honestly, I still felt a little bad for Sakura. Between\nour hike today and this foraging expedition, she was probably sick of\nspending so much time with me, but she wasn\u2019t the type to voice such a\nthing. In the end, Sakura seemed wary of both Yamauchi and me, working in\nalmost total silence.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this enough? This is probably good,\u201d Yamauchi said.\nIt was certainly true that we had enough for a full day. We finished up\nand headed back to the camp site.\n\u201cHey, hey, Sakura. Do you want me to help you carry that? It\u2019s gotta\nbe tough for a girl. You might hurt yourself.\u201d\nYamauchi must\u2019ve planned to ask her that from the very beginning,\neven though she was carrying only about half the amount I was. I supposed\nhe wanted to play the role of a caring and attentive guy. I wondered if\nYamauchi\u2019s kindness would stand out, especially in comparison to me.\n", "\u201cI-I\u2019m fine\u2026 Ayanokouji-kun is carrying a lot, though. I\u2019d like you to\nhelp him.\u201d\n\u201cOooh! Sakura, you\u2019re so kind! Jeez, aren\u2019t you being greedy,\nAyanokouji, carrying that much by yourself? Here, I\u2019ll take half, hand \u2019em\nover.\u201d\nWith that, he grabbed about half of the amount he\u2019d thrust toward me\nearlier. Despite Sakura\u2019s refusal, it looked like this was part of his strategy to\nwin her with kindness. Yamauchi, looking satisfied, walked off in high\nspirits. As we walked, something appeared on the path ahead.\nA lone girl sat with her back up against a large tree. She wasn\u2019t a Class\nD student. When she noticed us, she looked up and then quickly averted her\neyes. Since she was from another class, it\u2019d be fine for us to leave her alone,\nbut the state she was in suggested that this was no trivial matter.\nThere was a red, swollen mark on her cheek. Someone had hit her\npretty hard. When Yamauchi started to pass the girl, I grabbed him by the\nshoulder.\n", "\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOh, uh\u2026sorry. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nI was going to say something, but he finally noticed the girl.\n\u201cHey. What\u2019s the matter? Are you okay?\u201d Yamauchi called.\n\u201cJust leave me alone. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way. Who did this to you? Should I call a teacher?\u201d\nConsidering the swelling, it was easy to see that she was in a fair\namount of pain.\n\u201cJust a class dispute. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d answered the girl, laughing\nin self-deprecation. Her voice was low and even, but it was clear she wasn\u2019t\nfeeling well. She seemed rather shaken.\n\u201cSo, what are you going to do? We just can\u2019t leave you here.\u201d\nThis was not our school campus. We were surrounded by jungle on all\nsides. In a couple hours, the sun would begin to set. If she were out here\nalone in the dark, it could be disastrous.\n\u201cWe\u2019re Class D students. Why not come to our base camp?\u201d\nYamauchi turned to Sakura and me for approval. We nodded in\nagreement.\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying? There\u2019s no way I could do something like\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean, wouldn\u2019t you say it\u2019s only natural to help someone in\ntrouble?\u201d\nShe seemed to not want to listen to us. She turned away and fell silent.\nIn most situations it would\u2019ve been easy to leave her, but we couldn\u2019t leave\nan injured girl in a place like this.\n\u201cI\u2019m from Class C. In other words, I\u2019m your enemy. You understand\nthat, right?\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t any reason not to help.\n\u201cBut we just can\u2019t leave you. Right?\u201d\nBoth Sakura and I nodded. Still, the girl didn\u2019t seem to want to move.\n", "Since we were students at the same school, it seemed natural and right for us\nto help each other. Whether or not it was the right thing to do in this special\ntest was another question entirely.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave you, so we\u2019re going to stay here until you move.\u201d\nYamauchi was resolved. In that case, we had to wait on standby. The\ngirl didn\u2019t want to speak to us; she probably thought we wanted to trick her.\n\u201cBesides, the forest is all humid and muggy. The heat\u2019s really intense.\nSakura, you\u2019re hot, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m actually\u2026 I\u2019m okay.\u201d\nThough standing here could be quite boring, this was a dream come\ntrue from Yamauchi\u2019s point of view. He could spend time together with\nSakura until this other girl gave in. Yamauchi spent his time meaningfully,\npeppering both the girl and Sakura with a ton of questions. After about ten\nminutes, the girl lost her patience.\n\u201cYou guys are really stupid. You\u2019re not acting logically. You aren\u2019t\nthinking about your own class.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t leave a girl alone when she\u2019s in trouble.\u201d\nYamauchi gave a thumbs-up. Sakura\u2019s impression of him was probably\nimproving, though she didn\u2019t seem to pay attention to Yamauchi\u2019s great\nefforts. She just gazed at the forest and the sky. For a shy girl like Sakura,\nthis unexpected situation was likely uncomfortable.\n\u201cBut is that really okay? To tell me where your base camp is, and\nmoreover, to guide me there?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Is that wrong?\u201d\nYamauchi didn\u2019t understand what the girl was saying.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe what an incredible idiot you are! Seriously, I can\u2019t\nbelieve it,\u201d said the girl, looking shocked.\nYamauchi was taken aback. If you knew the location of someone\u2019s\ncampsite, you could start to get a read on how they planned to conduct\nthemselves throughout the test. You could get into their heads and anticipate\ntheir strategies. In Class D\u2019s case, announcing our spot was a reason to be\nconcerned. But I spoke up.\n", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d I said.\n\u201cRight? Yeah, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem. My name\u2019s Yamauchi\nHaruki. Nice to meet you!\u201d\n\u201cWell, you seem like you\u2019re a good guy. But you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d The girl\nappeared shocked by Yamauchi\u2019s self-introduction. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026Ibuki,\u201d she said in\na clear voice.\nShe lightly caressed her red, swollen cheek. It must\u2019ve been painful.\nShe didn\u2019t look us in the eyes as she spoke. Maybe she wasn\u2019t good at social\ncontact or something. I noticed a small amount of dirt under Ibuki\u2019s nails. If\nyou looked to where she\u2019d been sitting, you could see disturbances in the soil.\n\u201cWhoa, so do girls, like, slap each other across the cheek when they\nfight or something?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your concern. Leave me alone.\u201d\nDespite her words, it wasn\u2019t like we could do that, considering her\nobvious pain. She seemed to be dealing with it, but her agony occasionally\nregistered on her face as she stroked her cheek. Ibuki slung a bag over her\nshoulder, wincing at her burden. Upon seeing that, Yamauchi\u2019s eyes lit up.\n\u201cWell, at least let me take your bag for you. Huh? Huh?\u201d\nYamauchi wanted to display his manliness in front of Sakura by any\nmeans necessary, so he once again thrust his branches over to me to hold.\nHow gentlemanly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. H-hey, it\u2019s fine. Knock it off!\u201d\nShe flatly refused to let Yamauchi carry her bag, perhaps because she\ndidn\u2019t want to rely on us. She let go of the bag, which fell and struck a tree,\nmaking a dull thud sound. The awkwardness increased as Yamauchi\nfrantically apologized.\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to do anything bad. I apologize.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just that I still don\u2019t trust you guys. You understand?\u201d\nIbuki, with nothing further to say, fell silent. Yamauchi gave up and\nstarted walking. If he wasn\u2019t going to carry the bag, then he could\u2019ve carried\nthose branches. They poked me thoroughly on the way back to base camp.\n", "2.7\nWe gathered up the branches and returned to camp. Being from a\ndifferent class, Ibuki didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble, so she sat further\naway. It would\u2019ve been impossible for her to blend in, so we appreciated her\nhonesty. If she stayed within our sight, she probably wouldn\u2019t cause trouble.\nHirata was gone, unfortunately. That meant Yamauchi, Sakura, and I had to\nget the bonfire going. We wouldn\u2019t be able to get a fire going in the dark, so\nwe had to hurry.\n\u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll show you an easy way.\u201d\nYamauchi produced a matchbox he\u2019d received from Hirata, and\ncrouched before the stacked branches. He took one match, and quickly\nscratched the tip against the rough strip. We heard repeated scratching\nsounds, like \u201ctch\u201d, but the match didn\u2019t light.\n\u201cDamn, this is pretty hard\u2026\u201d\nSakura stood next to him and watched. Yamauchi tried to look cool,\nbut for someone unused to matches, it probably wasn\u2019t easy. Still, he struck\nthe match over and over, until suddenly it lit.\n\u201cOh, oh, there! Got it!\u201d\nFinally. In a panic, Yamauchi brought the match down to the bundle of\nsticks. But only light smoke came out, and after waiting a really long time it\ndidn\u2019t seem that the fire was going to start.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we need to carefully get the fire onto the branches themselves?\nRight now it seems impossible.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try that next time. Ah, jeez, that one failed too. Are these\nmatches defective or something?\u201d\nWe were having such a hard time lighting a fire with one match, we\nwondered whether we\u2019d be able to light a bonfire at all. Yamauchi was\ngetting increasingly frustrated, and began striking the matches more\nforcefully against the strip. As a result, he broke several.\n", "\u201cIf I keep messing up, we\u2019re gonna be in trouble.\u201d\nThree broken matchsticks lay at Yamauchi\u2019s feet. He tried to regain his\ncomposure.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s going to be all right. We still have\nmore.\u201d\nHe opened the matchbox and showed it to me. It looked light, but there\nwere about twenty or more in there. However, at this rate we might run out\nbefore the week was through.\n\u201cAll right! This time I got it for sure!\u201d\nHe carefully lit the match and slowly brought it toward the branch.\nThough it seemed like the fire was desperately trying its best, it didn\u2019t\ndevelop as desired. It ended up only smoldering a little, causing more smoke.\n\u201cWhat the hell?! What am I doing wrong? I\u2019m going to go ask the\nteacher.\u201d\nYamauchi had wanted to look cool in front of Sakura, but that was over\nwith now. He started frantically searching for Chabashira-sensei. He should\nhave thought this through before trying it, obviously. I crouched down and\njostled the branches.\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t the fire start?\u201d\nSakura crouched next to me, looking at the burned branches with a\npuzzled expression.\n\u201cI thought since they\u2019re wood they\u2019d burn easily, but I guess fire is\nweaker than I initially imagined,\u201d I said.\nShe didn\u2019t seem to understand what I meant by that, so she tilted her\nhead slightly quizzically.\n\u201cWell, when you see bonfires in movies, you typically see these large\nbranches, right? That\u2019s why we picked these up. But maybe you can\u2019t start a\nfire with large branches?\u201d\nI separated the branches, snapped off a thin one, and showed it to her.\n\u201cI feel like next time, we should line up branches of this size. Also, a\nlot of the branches are damp.\u201d\nTrying to set a fire with damp wood was the mark of an amateur. Even\n", "if Yamauchi had used dozens of matches, the fire likely wouldn\u2019t have\nspread.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to require a little work on our end, but I think we should\nhead back into the forest to get dry, thin branches, and leaves that\u2019ll burn\neasy.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you guys doing over there?\u201d\nIke, who\u2019d gone for a swim, had returned just as we ran through our\ntrial and error.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of trying to start the bonfire. It\u2019s not going so\nwell, though. We\u2019re having a tough time.\u201d\n\u201cA bonfire? Wait, these thick branches aren\u2019t going to catch on fire.\nYou need to start with smaller branches, you know? The branches you got\nhere are way too big. Also, a bunch of \u2019em are damp, too. This is no good at\nall!\u201d\n\u201cAh, but, Ayanokouji-kun\u2026\u201d\nI interrupted Sakura as she attempted to speak up for me.\n\u201cI see. If you don\u2019t mind, could you tell us what to do?\u201d\n\u201cJeez, guess I don\u2019t got a choice, huh? Okay, time for a brief lecture.\nWait a second, I\u2019ll go collect some good things from around here.\u201d\nIke set down his swimsuit bag and went into the forest. He returned\nsoon after. He\u2019d picked up a bunch of branches of different sizes, from thin to\nmedium thickness. Also, he\u2019d collected a bundle of dead leaves.\n\u201cI got some good branches. I think we\u2019ll be able to manage with these.\u201d\nWith that, he picked up the matchbook that Yamauchi had set down,\nand quickly set fire to the dead leaves. As the leaves kindled, he started\nadding some small twigs. Then, watching the fire carefully, he gradually\nadded in thicker branches. In the blink of an eye, the flame turned into a\ntypical bonfire.\n\u201cAnd that should do it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m really impressed. Someone with real camping\nexperience is on another level.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the basics. Starting a bonfire, I mean. Once you know how,\n", "anyone can do it.\u201d\nSince so few students in Class D had that kind of experience, Ike was\nbecoming crucial to our success.\n\u201cAh, damn it! The teacher didn\u2019t tell me a damn thing. Whoa! Hey,\nhow\u2019d the bonfire get going?!\u201d\nYamauchi had returned, and was astonished to see such a splendid\nbonfire. Perhaps he felt frustrated that he hadn\u2019t been able to show off,\nbecause he started complaining. I decided to leave the bonfire issues to Ike\nand Yamauchi, and left.\n\u201cH-hey, Ayanokouji-kun\u2026 Even though you\u2019d figured it out, was that\nokay? To not tell them?\u201d Sakura asked.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether I was correct or not, so it wouldn\u2019t have\nmattered. Besides, building up Ike and displaying his usefulness will be more\nhelpful to the class.\u201d\nMaybe I was rambling, but I just said what I was thinking. Sakura gave\nme a certain look, like she was moved by my words. For some reason, I felt\nstupidly embarrassed.\n\u201cSorry. I\u2019m a little tired, so I\u2019m going to rest. Thank you, Sakura.\u201d\nI went a short distance from the campsite. Chabashira-sensei, who was\npreparing a personal tent for herself nearby, stared in my direction. I\npretended not to notice.\n", "2.8\nOnce five o\u2019clock arrived, Kushida and her group returned. Hirata\nhad apparently joined up with Kushida\u2019s group. Since this was the return of\nour class\u2019 central figures, nearly half the class began to gather together.\nApparently, they\u2019d gone out searching for food. We could see they\u2019d been\nsuccessful. From a distance, I saw little red fruits, like strawberries, and\nmaybe tomatoes. They also seemed to have grapes and kiwis.\n\u201cIs this\u2026 Can we eat these, I wonder? I mean, that looks like fruit,\nbut\u2026\u201d\nThe students didn\u2019t seem too confident.\n\u201cEven so, I\u2019m really thirsty\u2026 I\u2019m hungry, too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting thirsty, too\u2026\u201d\nWhen evening came, it was understandable that the students would\nstart saying those kinds of things. I was one of them. As dinnertime drew\nnear, our food and water problems were highlighted.\n\u201cOh hey, this is bog bilberry! Did you find these, Kikyou-chan? That\u2019s\namazing, y\u2019know!\u201d\nIke came over, checking out the fruit and telling us what was what.\n\u201cKanji-kun, do you know what this is?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a fruit, a bog bilberry. I\u2019ve eaten \u2019em before when I went\ncamping in the mountains. As you can tell, they look and taste like\nblueberries. It\u2019s the akebia quinata. It\u2019s sweet and tasty. Oh wow, this really\ntakes me back, man.\u201d\nHe was being genuine, not trying to appear cool. Everyone watched Ike\nwith interest as he smiled, enjoying the nostalgic fruit. Shinohara bombarded\nIke with questions, and he answered her directly.\n\u201cAh. Let\u2019s see. Ah, that feels better than I thought.\u201d\nDespite countless disturbances, at least we were organized with this\none small thing. Even though it was only a small amount, the fact that we\u2019d\nfound food was a relief.\n", "\u201cLooks like you were able to get the bonfire going. Thanks,\nAyanokouji-kun.\u201d\n\u201cYou should be thanking Ike, not me.\u201d\nThe smoke billowed, large enough to make a good smoke signal. Ike\nexplained, \u201cIf you can see the smoke, you\u2019ll be able to find the campsite even\nif you get lost, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how we returned to the camp so quickly. It\u2019s all thanks to\nyou, Kanji-kun!\u201d\nThis also meant we ran the risk of other classes finding us, though.\nKushida and several others realized this, and nodded in understanding. I\nwould\u2019ve thought that so much attention and respect would\u2019ve given Ike a\nbig head, but he wasn\u2019t looking for praise from Kushida. Instead, he looked\nat Shinohara.\n\u201cHey, Shinohara. I spent some time thinking about how I acted today,\nabout the toilet and stuff and how stubborn I was. I was pushy because I\nwanted to save points. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWh-why are you apologizing to me all of the sudden?\u201d\n\u201cI just remembered the first time I went camping. The toilet was awful,\nand of course there were bugs crawling around everywhere. Just about\neverything was dirty. I remember going to my parents, complaining how\nmuch I hated going to the bathroom and telling them I wanted to go home.\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s even worse for a girl\u2026\u201d\nIke was amazing. He\u2019d grasped the situation himself and handled\nthings calmly. He had the potential to go far, unlike an ordinary person like\nme. It definitely took courage to say what he\u2019d said. The courage and the\napology came slowly, but Shinohara responded apologetically as well.\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026sorry for earlier, too. For saying that I couldn\u2019t drink from the\nriver. I think I got way too emotional. We won\u2019t be able to keep any of our\npoints if we don\u2019t learn to adjust.\u201d\nEven though neither of them looked the other straight in the eyes, it\nseemed they\u2019d made up. Perhaps Class D might end up with points after all.\nThe other students probably took this as a good sign. Hirata, determined not\nto let this opportunity pass, raised his hand and gathered everyone\u2019s attention.\n", "\u201cEveryone, I have an announcement. This special test is a first for all of\nus. I understand you\u2019re confused. Also, everyone sees things their own way,\nso it\u2019s only natural that there\u2019ll be some disputes. However, I want us all to\npush forward and trust in each other until the very end, without panicking.\u201d\nHirata spoke those words clearly. After composing himself, he\ncontinued.\n\u201cAfter all, everyone here wants to end up with at least one point, right?\nTherefore, I tried to come up with a number that we can realistically aim for.\nBy the end of the test, we could have 120 points or more left over. That\u2019s\nwhat Class D is fighting for.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words, you plan on using 180 points? I\u2019m not sure I agree,\nHirata.\u201d\nYukimura glared as if using more than half of our points were an\nunforgivable crime. Hirata, sensing the potential danger ahead, placed the\nmanual on the ground and explained.\n\u201cI\u2019d like you to listen to everything I have to say. First, let\u2019s suppose\nthat we\u2019re going to use points for all our meals. If we try to spend the least\namount possible, that means purchasing the nutritious meal and mineral\nwater sets.\u201d\nThe food and drinking water normally cost six points per individual\nunit, but as a set it only cost ten points. Ten points per meal eaten twice a day\ncame to a daily loss of twenty points. If we ordered one meal tonight and one\non the final day of the test, that came to a total of twelve meals. That would\nbe 120 points altogether. If we managed to put up with it on the last day and\nskip a meal, then the deduction would equal 110 points. If we added the\ntwenty points we spent on a temporary toilet to that, as well as the cost for\ntwo tents for the guys, which was also twenty points, then we\u2019d have 150\npoints. The remaining thirty points had probably been factored in to cover\nany miscellaneous things we might need, bringing the estimated total to 180\npoints.\nEveryone silently listened to Hirata\u2019s explanation.\n\u201cI understand that when you hear we\u2019ll have 120 points remaining, you\nprobably feel that\u2019s not enough. However, we\u2019re dwelling on these 300 points\ntoo much. If you look at the results of the midterm and the final exam, then\n", "the reason will be easy to understand, I think.\u201d\nWe\u2019d received an increase in class points before vacation. Even Class\nA, regarded as our superior, didn\u2019t see an addition of more than 100 points.\nYou certainly couldn\u2019t call 120 points a small number. In addition, because\nwe could gain points depending on the number of times we were able to\noccupy a space, we might end up with more than 120.\n\u201cBesides, I\u2019m talking about our lower limit for points. If we can find\nfood and water to make it through the day, we adjust our calculations and\nsave as many as twenty points. If we can find drinking water for the week,\nwe\u2019ll save fifty points or more.\u201d\nHirata looked at the river as he spoke. Its value instantly increased in\nour eyes.\n\u201cI see\u2026 So if we can endure it, that alone would change things a great\ndeal\u2026\u201d\nAnyone else could have come up with this, but Hirata\u2019s tone and\npresentation sold it. He\u2019d performed flawlessly. First he told us about the\nlower limit, and then explained that we could end up with nearly 200 points.\nIn that way, he succeeded in motivating everyone to reach a high goal. If we\ndid our best, we could end up with lots of points. More than that, we could\ngreatly increase the number of points we had by making an effort.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, right, Hirata? We can earn at least 120 points. If we work\nhard, we can even earn additional points, right? Then we should definitely\ntry!\u201d\nIke, who\u2019d thus far been the most confrontational, shouted in\nagreement. Sudou and Yamauchi both looked as though they agreed because\nthey didn\u2019t really have another choice. Yukimura still appeared reluctant, but\nseeing Ike join with Hirata made him fold.\n\u201cAh, that reminds me, Hirata. I wanted to check something,\u201d I said.\nBecause Yamauchi had forgotten to report on Ibuki, I didn\u2019t have any\nchoice. However, our classmates continued their excited discussion, and I\ndidn\u2019t have any chance to butt in.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fate of a popular person, I guess. Well, I\u2019ll try giving it a\nlittle time.\u201d\n", "I approached Ibuki, who\u2019d been watching from further away.\n\u201cSorry. Can you wait a little longer? I\u2019m going to talk to him about\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to force yourself. I\u2019d probably end up just getting in\nthe way.\u201d\nIbuki pulled up a handful of grass, looking pissed.\n\u201cAfter all, they\u2019ll chase me out anyway. Am I wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Hirata is an exceptionally good guy.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t imagine that Hirata would kick her out if he knew about her\nsituation.\n\u201cOh, I never introduced myself before. My name\u2019s Ayanokouji.\u201d\n\u201cSo, should I introduce myself once more then?\u201d\n\u201cNah. You\u2019re Ibuki, from Class C. I remember.\u201d\nWe faced each other through the introductions, but Ibuki wouldn\u2019t look\nme in the eyes.\n\u201cFor future reference, can everyone here who\u2019s okay with drinking\nriver water please raise your hand?\u201d Ike asked.\nThe discussion moved on to the next topic, leaving Ibuki and Class C\nbehind. Ike wasn\u2019t forcing anyone to drink the water, but he did want to see\nwhat everyone\u2019s opinions were. Of course, he took the initiative and raised\nhis hand in support of the river. Nearly half of the guys raised their hands in\napparent agreement. Shinohara looked a little perplexed, but Ike gently told\nher that she didn\u2019t have to force herself.\n\u201cI-I want to do my best, but\u2026I\u2019m a little scared, I think.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s about what Sudou said about boiling water, it\u2019s really not that\nbad. If you\u2019re scared of drinking it directly, how about we try it out first?\u201d\nA few more students agreed. Gradually, a matter that had once been\nstrongly rejected was now edging toward acceptance. Shinohara still\nappeared fearful, but raised her hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can drink it, but\u2026I\u2019m up for the challenge.\u201d\n\u201cI agree. If the first person who tries can drink it, then it should be\n", "fine.\u201d\nOther students looked amenable to that, and then Kushida followed suit\nand raised her own hand. Perhaps she was trying to influence the group?\nSoon everyone had their hands raised except for Horikita and me. Everyone\nstared at us, and we slowly raised our hands as well. However, it was still\ndifficult for people to start drinking from the river. In order to have some\nemergency supplies, we had decided to buy some water, just in case.\n\u201cI have a request, Ike-kun. I want you to lend me your talents from here\non out. It looks like you\u2019re the only one with camping experience here. Can\nyou help me out?\u201d Hirata asked.\n\u201cW-well, I guess if you ask, I gotta cooperate.\u201d\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\nHirata practically jumped for joy at Ike\u2019s curt reply. Shinohara, who\u2019d\ncomplained the most before, didn\u2019t object. Hirata started gathering opinions\nabout food.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be dark soon, so for now all we can do is order food.\nHowever, I ask you to think a little about tomorrow onward. There might be\nvarious foodstuffs nearby, so I wanted to explore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, nearby? Do you mean other than where Kushida-\nsan and the others found the fruit?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. The river. It\u2019d be great if we can catch and eat fish. It looks like\nthere are quite a few freshwater fish in there. We\u2019d be able to limit our point\nspending to some extent. Also, catching fish and cooking them over the\nbonfire sounds really tasty.\u201d\n\u201cWell, putting aside whether or not they\u2019d be tasty, how do you plan on\ncatching fish?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll dive in the water. I haven\u2019t done it before, though.\u201d\nIke made a swimming motion, but it probably wouldn\u2019t be easy to\ncatch fish by skin diving.\n\u201cEven though it might sound impossible to catch a fish with your bare\nhands, there are lots of tools,\u201d said Hirata, pointing to an entry in the manual.\n\u201cFishing rods.\u201d They had a variety, too.\n", "\u201cIt\u2019s one point for fishing rods with bait, and two points for fishing\nrods with lures.\u201d\nIt wouldn\u2019t be difficult to recover the cost. It might even be a big win\nfor us, if we could earn food for one or two days by spending just one point.\nAnd even if we didn\u2019t happen to catch anything, the cost was so minimal that\nit couldn\u2019t really hurt us. There were no objections.\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s decided. Let\u2019s get ourselves a fishing rod and catch\nsome fish! Of course, we\u2019ll go with the cheaper one.\u201d\nAnd so we settled on our goal of catching fish from the river and\nforaging for berries in the forest. If we were successful, we\u2019d decide whether\nor not to purchase a set of cooking utensils for an additional five points. Also,\nwe decided to spend another twenty points to install one shower. We\nexpected opposition, but our health might worsen if we only used cold water.\nThe guys were only allowed to use the shower in the middle of the night,\nthough. All of the girls seemed to agree that they\u2019d drink water from the\nriver. So, with the opposition convinced, the motion passed.\n\u201cBy the way\u2026 That girl, Ibuki-san from Class C? I\u2019ve seen her\nbefore.\u201d\nA girl named Satou, who had finally noticed the interloper, eyed Ibuki\nwith suspicion. Ibuki continued to quietly sit far away. Apparently there was\nno need for me to break the ice.\n\u201cWell, it sounds like there\u2019s been some kind of trouble in her class\u2026\u201d\nYamauchi, a little flustered, explained why Ibuki seemed to have been\nisolated from her classmates.\n\u201cI see. Your judgment was correct. We can\u2019t just leave her.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Hirata-kun\u2026 Couldn\u2019t she be a spy? I mean, if she can spot the\nleader\u2026\u201d Yamauchi asked, hands over his head for attention.\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. I suppose it\u2019s possible. I\u2019ll check on it. Is that okay,\nYamauchi-kun? Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d\nHirata headed over to Ibuki. Had he excluded Sakura because of his\npretty-boy thoughtfulness? Sakura seemed relieved to not be noticed.\n\u201cDo you have a moment, Ibuki-san? I wanted to talk to you,\u201d Hirata\nsaid.\n", "\u201cI\u2019m probably just getting in the way. You\u2019ve already taken good care\nof me.\u201d\nShe quickly stood, as if she wanted to run.\n\u201cWait a minute. I wanted to ask what happened. I want to help.\u201d\nShe stopped at Hirata\u2019s words. After seeing her swollen face, Hirata\nhad likely surmised that the issue wasn\u2019t trivial.\n\u201cNothing will change if I stay. I don\u2019t want to waste time just sitting\naround.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a test, so of course some students will doubt you. However,\nyou\u2019re hurt. I don\u2019t want to chase you away if you can\u2019t go back to your own\nclass. I think that\u2019s why Yamauchi-kun brought you here. So, tell me about\nyour situation.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something I can just talk about. Besides, I\u2019ve heard all your\nplans. You\u2019d hate it if more of your strategies were leaked, right?\u201d\nIbuki started walking away. Hirata stopped her in her tracks.\n\u201cIf you really were a spy, you wouldn\u2019t want to be chased out, would\nyou? Am I wrong?\u201d\n\u201cEnough. I\u2019m just looking for a place to sleep.\u201d\nAs I expected, she wasn\u2019t going to return to Class C. The sun was\nsetting, and it\u2019d be night soon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy for a girl to sleep alone in the woods.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s crazy, I don\u2019t have a choice. Helping me won\u2019t gain you\nanything.\u201d\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with losses or gains. We can\u2019t just leave\nsomeone in trouble. We all think so.\u201d\nHer expression cleared, and she turned toward us without hesitation.\nSomething like that was designed to melt even the toughest exterior. Ibuki\nseemed to believe Hirata, and it gave her confidence.\n\u201cI had a fight with a boy in my class. He hit me and chased me away.\nThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible. Raising a hand against a girl, I mean.\u201d\n", "I hadn\u2019t expected it, either. I\u2019d thought for sure she\u2019d been in a fight\nwith another girl.\n\u201cI won\u2019t say anything more on the subject. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d take me\nin and give me shelter, anyway. See you.\u201d\n\u201cWait. I understand that you\u2019re really in trouble. Please give me a little\ntime. If you can do that, I\u2019ll tell the other students about your situation and\nsee if we can find a place for you. Ayanokouji-kun, can you watch Ibuki-san?\nI\u2019m going to go talk to everyone.\u201d\nHirata left us and returned to the group. I wondered if Hirata had left\nme with her because he trusted me, or at least trusted me more than\nYamauchi. I was a little curious.\n\u201cHe\u2019s seriously a good-natured guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Ibuki asked.\n\u201cI think everyone here is, more or less. Are there not people like that in\nyour class?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all\u2026 There isn\u2019t really anyone in Class C like that.\u201d\nIbuki sat down, bunched her knees against her chest, and lowered her\nhead. Thanks to Hirata\u2019s persuasiveness, Class D agreed to look after Ibuki.\nThough some students were strongly opposed, every time Class C held roll\ncall, they\u2019d hemorrhage points. Once everyone saw it as an opportunity, they\nwere finally convinced. Hirata\u2019s intentions had been pure, but the same\nwasn\u2019t true for others. The incentive of potential profit motivated them to\ntake the chance.\nHowever, maintaining exclusive possession of this place was an\nextremely delicate issue. We explained to Ibuki, and she promised not to\nwander near the device. If anyone realized that Horikita was the leader, the\ndamage we\u2019d suffer would be great. After that, we decided to purchase the\nnecessary food and water sets for tonight, along with the guys\u2019 tents. Thanks\nto Hirata and Ike, the tents were set up smoothly. Just before the sun set, we\nfinished all of our preparations, and the students began eating their meals.\n\u201cHey, Ibuki-san. Eat this.\u201d\nKushida approached Ibuki, who\u2019d been quietly sitting some distance\naway by herself. Kushida offered her one of the nutritious meal seats and a\nbottle of water.\n", "\u201cWhat? Why are you giving me this?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re probably hungry, right?\u201d\n\u201cFood is provided based on class numbers. There shouldn\u2019t be any\nspare sets left.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. But don\u2019t worry, we decided to share everything with our\ngroup.\u201d\nFurther away, the four other people from Kushida\u2019s group waved and\nsmiled at Ibuki. In other words, four people had shared three portions of food\nand water, and the leftover portion went to Ibuki.\n\u201cAre you guys stupid? You\u2019re all being way too nice.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shy. Eat up. Let\u2019s talk later, okay? I\u2019ll be waiting in the\ntent.\u201d\nWith that, Kushida returned to her group. It had seemed easy to help a\ngirl from another class until we had to reduce our own food portions. Then it\nwasn\u2019t so simple. But Kushida, who wished for everyone\u2019s happiness, had\ncharity to spare.\n\u201cWow, when you look at them like this, the girls\u2019 groups are kind of\nremarkable.\u201d\nYamauchi, in the middle of eating, pointed to each group individually.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the Empress Team, led by Karuizawa. Then there\u2019s Kushida-\nchan\u2019s Friendship Team and Shinohara\u2019s Arrogant Team. Then you have\nHorikita and Sakura, who are by themselves.\u201d\nAll of the guys huddled relatively close together as they ate, but the\ngirls sat in their individual teams. There was a clear wall between them, like\nthey were groups from other classes. Maybe Kushida\u2019s team was the most\nneutral of all of them, or just held a lot of influence?\n\u201cPoor Sakura, all alone. I wonder if I should eat with her,\u201d Yamauchi\nsaid.\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably better off giving up, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019d just\nscare her.\u201d\n\u201cDamn. I want to get to know her better, but she\u2019s way too\nintroverted\u2026\u201d\n", "In addition to being shy, Sakura probably found it difficult to deal with\npushy types like Yamauchi. Despite being warned, Yamauchi seemed\nimpatient to go over to her.\n\u201cWhat the hell, Haruki? That\u2019s no fair, stalking a lone beautiful woman\nlike that. Come on, let me join in!\u201d\nIke, seeing Yamauchi\u2019s glances, misunderstood and approached him.\n\u201cI have to say, Sakura\u2019s breasts are really something else. You don\u2019t\noften see breasts that big on a first-year high school student. Her clothes are\njust bulging. She\u2019s way too sexy. Her boobs alone make her even more\nattractive than Kikyou-chan.\u201d\nIke stared intently at Sakura\u2019s breasts, like he wanted to devour them.\nYamauchi blocked Ike\u2019s line of sight.\n\u201cHey, what the hell, dude?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t just look at Sakura like a pervert. Besides, you\u2019re aiming for\nKushida-san, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah. But it\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it? I mean, an idol belongs to\neveryone, right? Haruki, could you be\u2026 Ooh, are you Sakura\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI-It\u2019s not like that. Come on, let\u2019s eat.\u201d\nApparently Yamauchi wanted to hide the fact that he was changing\ntargets and going after Sakura. Besides, it was night, with nothing left to do.\nIt was only natural that the flow of the conversation would lead to the\nopposite sex. I noticed Hirata nearby, distributing food.\n\u201cCome to think of it, where\u2019s Kouenji-kun?\u201d\nEveryone had gathered, but it looked like Kouenji was absent.\n\u201cOh, Kouenji complained about being in poor physical condition and\nreturned to the ship. Of course, that means that you\u2019ve had thirty points\ndeducted. Those are the rules, so there\u2019s nothing to be done. Kouenji has\nretired, and he\u2019s obligated to stay onboard the ship for one week for medical\ntreatment,\u201d said Chabashira-sensei.\n\u201cWhaaaaat?!\u201d\nScreams sounded throughout the night.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve gotta be kidding me! Kouenji, you jerk! What the hell\n", "were you thinking?!\u201d The normally silent Yukimura shouted and kicked the\nground. I knew Kouenji was a free spirit, but I never imagined he would just\nup and retire. Maybe he didn\u2019t care about reaching Class A. If it made his life\neasier, losing thirty points didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\u201cGoddamn it! We lost thirty points! This sucks!\u201d\nBoth the boys and girls were furious over Kouenji\u2019s actions, but could\ndo nothing about it. Kouenji\u2019s loud, haughty laughter reverberated in our\nminds.\n", "Chapter 3:\nRivals on the Move\nI woke up much earlier that morning than I\u2019d anticipated. The heat\nand humidity had made me toss and turn in my sleep. It finally roused me,\nand I wasn\u2019t very well rested. My bed felt warm, and I remembered that we\u2019d\nkept the lamp on throughout the whole night. Our tent stank like sweat.\nFortunately, we\u2019d formed the tent with a mesh material because it allowed for\nthe night breeze to blow through. But once the night had ended, the\ntemperature rose significantly. I carefully slipped out of the tent so as to not\nwake anyone else, and approached our mountain of piled luggage.\nWe\u2019d kept the luggage outside in order to make the tents as spacious as\npossible. After looking around to make sure I was alone, I found a singularly\ncolored piece of luggage. It was Ibuki\u2019s bag. Since her bag was different, it\nwas easy to spot. I grabbed it without hesitation and checked inside. If\nsomeone saw me doing this, I\u2019d be instantly labeled a pervert. Inside, I found\nthe same kinds of things that everyone else had, like towels, a change of\nclothes, underwear, etc. However\u2026\n\u201cA digital camera, huh?\u201d\nThat explained the dull sound I\u2019d heard yesterday when she dropped\nthe bag against a tree. This item wasn\u2019t appropriate for a deserted island. On\nthe bottom of the camera, I found a rental sticker. Why did Ibuki have this? I\nconsidered the possible reasons, trying to think from her perspective. After\nconjuring up an image of her in my head, several possibilities suggested\nthemselves.\nI checked the camera\u2019s power source. It had no data, and no sign that\nit\u2019d been used. After I finished my inspection, I returned the item to the bag,\nand went back to the tent.\n\u201cGood morning, Ayanokouji-kun. Heading to the bathroom?\u201d\nHirata was awake. He turned around as he greeted me. Maybe he\nnoticed that I was sweatier than usual.\n\u201cAh. Did I wake you, by any chance?\u201d\n", "\u201cOh no. I can\u2019t exactly sleep soundly in this environment. Ouch,\nouch\u2026 Ah, my back hurts. Well, I guess that\u2019s only natural without a proper\nmattress.\u201d\nIt certainly wasn\u2019t easy to sleep when we were so crowded together,\nand without real beds to boot. But somehow, everyone else was still asleep.\nThey were probably tired out from yesterday\u2019s activity.\n\u201cIf you include Kouenji-kun\u2019s penalty, we spent almost 100 points\nyesterday. I told everyone that in the worst possible outcome we\u2019d be left\nwith 120 points, but now I\u2019m not even sure about that. I guess the anxiety\nwoke me.\u201d\nHirata took out the manual to confirm his fears. Kouenji\u2019s retirement\nhad been a pretty serious blow.\n\u201cThis is tough, even for the class peacemaker.\u201d I couldn\u2019t possibly\nfathom carrying this kind of responsibility. I peeked at the manual, and Hirata\nadjusted his position so that I could comfortably look at it. I was grateful for\nsuch small acts of consideration.\n\u201cI\u2019m only doing this because I like it. If my hard work makes everyone\nin class happy, then I\u2019m satisfied. But it\u2019s surprisingly difficult. How many\npoints we have after this special test will have a huge impact on our lives. I\nthink it\u2019s wrong to freak everybody out.\u201d\nMake everyone in class happy, huh? If such a thing were possible, it\nwould be amazing. But it was probably close to impossible. The school\u2019s\nsystem dictated as much.\n\u201cSo, if we have students who want to aim for Class A, and students\nwho want to stay in Class D, what do you do?\u201d\nWhile I knew that was a meaningless question, it accidentally came out\nsounding rather unkind. I guess I wanted Hirata\u2019s opinion, since he was\nbasically just a mass of good intentions.\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to answer. Aiming for the upper classes means forcing\neveryone\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I need to think on it.\u201d\nI wondered how often he\u2019d thought about it. Hirata smiled faintly.\n\u201cSo Ayanokouji-kun, do you want to get into Class A? Or are you fine\nas long as life at school is fun?\u201d\n", "\u201cI guess if I had to pick, school life\u2019s my priority. Besides, I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s possible to reach Class A.\u201d\n\u201cI see. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s simple. Even if our class came together as\none and aimed for Class A\u2026 I just think our first month\u2019s losses did too\nmuch damage.\u201d\nHirata was probably thinking about all the other students\u2019 limits. If\nClass A didn\u2019t fall in the rankings, making up the difference wouldn\u2019t be\neasy. Even if Class D managed to live conservatively during this exam, we\ncould only gain 100 to 150 points. Right now, even overtaking Class C\nseemed like a pipe dream.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient. First of all, Class D needs to come together and\nmake it through this test. After that, we can focus on the next goal.\u201d\nMost of us had decided to let Hirata take the lead. If we worked hard in\nthe short term, we\u2019d earn class points. Right now, ignoring the severe chasm\nbetween us and the other classes wasn\u2019t a bad idea. Hirata politely excused\nhimself and quietly headed to the toilet. I stretched out in the space left\nbehind by his absence.\nAt the very least, Class A had the cave. It was likely that Classes B and\nC also had spots somewhere. Even though we held the river, that alone might\nnot be enough. Once everyone was asleep, I neatly cut out one of the\nmanual\u2019s five blank pages. Then I took a ballpoint pen.\nAfter I replicated a simple map of the island, I folded it into a small\nsquare and put it in my pocket. Soon after, Hirata peeked in the tent\u2019s\nentrance.\n\u201cWant to come wash your face together with me?\u201d\nI accepted his offer. The tent\u2019s temperature was rising as the sun\nclimbed higher in the sky. We took towels from our vinyl-wrapped luggage\nand headed to the river. Hirata put the manual inside his pack. The jingle of\nplastic accessories banging together sounded from Hirata\u2019s bag.\n\u201cGifts or something from Karuizawa?\u201d\n\u201cSpot on. How\u2019d you guess?\u201d\nWho else would give him little heart-bedazzled presents? As we\nheaded to the river, we came across an unexpected person.\n", "\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nA student from Class B, Kanzaki, looked our way. Some other boys I\ndidn\u2019t know were with him, but they were probably Class B students, too.\nThey appeared surprised, as if they hadn\u2019t expected us at such an early hour,\nbut quickly regained their composure.\n\u201cFirst day\u2019s over, so I wondered how you were doing. I thought I\u2019d\ncheck on you. Your location\u2019s great.\u201d\nHe seemed legitimately impressed by our base camp. He didn\u2019t appear\nto have a hidden agenda.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Kanzaki-kun, from Class B, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHirata seemed to remember him.\n\u201cDid I surprise you? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not here to cause trouble.\u201d\nWith that apology, Kanzaki walked away.\n\u201cKanzaki. Where\u2019s Class B camping?\u201d\nMaybe he wouldn\u2019t tell us, but I thought I\u2019d try asking. Kanzaki\nanswered without hesitation.\n\u201cThere are large broken trees along the path from here to the beach. If\nyou enter the forest to the southwest and walk a bit, you can find our\ncampsite. You shouldn\u2019t get lost if you enter by those large trees. If you need\nsomething, go ahead and tell her you can come by.\u201d\nWith that, Kanzaki left. Hirata gave me a strange look.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s your friend, hmm? What\u2019d he mean by \u2018go ahead\nand tell her\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I wonder.\u201d\nKanzaki, Ichinose, and Horikita had recently worked together in a false\naccusation case. He probably thought they were still on good terms.\n\u201cI wonder if they came here to do some reconnaissance, see how we\u2019ve\nspent our points.\u201d\nDoubtless that was one reason, after seeing Kanzaki\u2019s slightly\napologetic expression. You could estimate the number of points spent just by\nthe number of toilets, showers, and tents. However, that was probably not the\n", "only thing Kanzaki and the others wanted to know. They must\u2019ve wanted to\ndiscover our class leader. After all, the rights of exclusive spot possession\nexpired every eight hours.\nPerhaps they\u2019d calculated the renewal time and hoped to see the spot\nupdated. However, we\u2019d planned for that. That\u2019s why we postponed the\nsecond update yesterday, so the rights of ownership were adjusted to expire\nright after eight o\u2019clock. That way, it was possible to use the big crowds from\nroll call as a kind of camouflage for the update.\nHirata seemed to be more anxious. He muttered while drying off.\n\u201cI wonder if our strategy\u2019s wrong. Even if we can\u2019t beat the other\nclasses, I thought it\u2019d be good for us to unify on this test. That\u2019s the real\nreason I don\u2019t want them to discover our leader.\u201d\nHis hair glistened with water. A splendidly handsome man faced such\nconstant trouble.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much. You should relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. Coming from you, that honestly makes me really happy.\u201d\nAfter I washed my face, I scooped up some water for a drink. Even\nthough the forest was insanely hot, the river water was cool and delicious.\nThe water here was groundwater that flowed into the river as spring water,\nmaking it naturally resistant to warming or cooling. Since it came from\nupstream, the water\u2019s temperature was resistant to heating. We\u2019d been lucky\nto secure this place as our base.\n\u201cFirst, I think we need to adjust our sleeping arrangements. Since the\nground\u2019s so hard here, this week will be tough without proper back support.\nWhen everyone wakes up, I\u2019m going to take a poll. We have to cooperate and\ndo our best.\u201d\n", "3.1\nAfter morning roll call, we began to explore. Hirata provided roles to\nthe more reliable students, starting his plan to save us points. Meanwhile, the\nless helpful students and the more independently-minded like Horikita and I\ndid as we pleased.\n\u201cWhat the hell, you guys?!\u201d\nIke\u2019s angry voice boomed throughout the campsite. I looked in his\ndirection, and saw two male students wearing wide, smug grins. A pained\nexpression flashed across Ibuki\u2019s face for a moment, but then she quickly\nducked behind the tent to hide herself.\n\u201cKomiya and Kondou, huh?\u201d\nLike Ibuki, I recognized those guys. They were from Class C.\n\u201cWow, you Class D rejects are really living frugal, eh? I guess that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019d expect from a class of defectives.\u201d\nThey were stuffing their faces with potato chips and drinking bottles of\nsoda. Not water. Soda.\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re living the high life, Class C.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know Ryuuen?\u201d Ibuki asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Class C student. I\u2019ve heard various rumors about him. He\u2019s\npretty crazy, I hear.\u201d\n\u201cNot just \u2018pretty\u2019 crazy. Everything that guy does is crazy.\u201d\nIbuki sounded irritated, as if she were discussing a family enemy.\n\u201cThose two are Ryuuen\u2019s friends. I\u2019d say they\u2019re more like his\nunderlings, though.\u201d\nI recalled the time those two had fought with Sudou. It\u2019d seemed like\nthey were acting on orders from Ryuuen, rather than just looking for a fight.\n\u201cWhat did you even eat for breakfast? Grass? Or maybe bugs? Here,\nyou can have some snacks.\u201d\nThey took a bag of potato chips and tossed it near Ike\u2019s feet as he drew\n", "nearer. Though it was obvious that they were trying to start something, we\ncouldn\u2019t help getting irritated.\n\u201cWe have a message from Ryuuen-san. If you want to enjoy your\nsummer vacation to the fullest, come to the beach right now. Don\u2019t hang\nback. If you\u2019re sick of living like idiots, then we\u2019re happy to share our\nluxuries.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t leave, but continued snacking as if trying to harass us. Ike\nsnapped at them, but they didn\u2019t seem to care. The provocation continued for\nat least ten more minutes, until Hirata\u2019s group returned and Class C decided\nto call it quits. They headed back toward their campsite.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they were looking for me,\u201d Ibuki said.\n\u201cYeah. Guess they wanted to harass us.\u201d\nTheir bizarre visit aside, we\u2019d obtained valuable information about\nClass C: they had luxury items, snacks and soda and so on. They\u2019d been\nburning through points. In a test like this, where frugality was crucial, what in\nthe world were they thinking?\n\u201cThey said something about sharing their luxuries. Any idea what they\nwere talking about?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI wonder if things are heading toward that worst-case scenario I\nimagined\u2026\u201d\nIbuki said nothing more, but headed toward a tree on the camp\u2019s\nperiphery. The worst-case scenario she\u2019d imagined, huh? Telling Horikita\nabout this seemed like a good idea.\n\u201cHey, Horikita, you around?\u201d\nAfter breakfast, Horikita had immediately returned to the tent, and I\nsaw no sign of her. I called for her in front of the girls\u2019 tent. Although she\ndidn\u2019t reply, the tent shook slightly, and I heard the sounds of cloth rubbing\ntogether. Horikita slowly stepped outside.\n\u201cDid you hear those voices earlier?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe cheap provocation coming from Class C? Yes, I heard.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a little worried. I want to check out the situation. Care to come?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather unusual to see you taking initiative. Are you feeling well?\u201d\n", "I\u2019d have loved to throw those words back in her face.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m free for a week. I don\u2019t have anything to do today, so I\u2019ve\njust been killing time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to move too much. Since I\u2019m the leader, if I stand out too\nmuch, we\u2019ll be in a bad spot.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a definite risk.\u201d\nEven if someone didn\u2019t know a leader\u2019s identity for certain, they might\nguess correctly if they noticed suspicious behavior. The more conspicuous a\nperson, the more attention they would draw.\n\u201cI understand how you feel, but even if you stay in here, the situation\nprobably won\u2019t change, right? You\u2019ve got eyes on Ryuuen, and you\u2019ve even\nbeen observing Ichinose. People will remember that you\u2019re the student\ncouncil president\u2019s younger sister. No matter what you do, you\u2019ll be a target.\u201d\nAt any rate, the penalty for a wrong guess was fifty points. When we\u2019d\nappointed someone as leader, we\u2019d taken a gamble, and precautions were\nnecessary.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I suppose I can\u2019t say what\u2019s correct. Fine. I\u2019m rather\nconcerned about the state of the other classes. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nHorikita and I set out for the beach, where Class C awaited. Her heavy\nfootsteps seemed to belie her casual indifference.\n", "3.2\nAs we neared the edge of the forest, we saw the beach, and the large\ngroup of Class C students on that beach. Horikita and I could never have\nimagined the situation we beheld.\n\u201cNo way\u2026 All this stuff\u2026 Is it even possible?\u201d\nEven beholding the very real spectacle, Horikita kept repeating the\nword \u201cimpossible.\u201d I felt the same. They had installed temporary toilets and\nshower rooms. But they also had a tarp to protect against sunlight, a\nbarbecue, chairs, and a parasol. They had snacks and drinks. Everything\nrequired for a good, relaxing time was here. We smelled the smoke of\ncooking meat, and heard laughter. Jet skis whizzed past the shoreline.\nStudents were enjoying themselves in the ocean, screaming with joy. Based\non a rough calculation, they\u2019d likely spent 150 points or more.\n\u201cWhat in the world is Class C doing? Do they not plan to save points?\u201d\nThat was the sole explanation. This went beyond splurging.\n\u201cLet\u2019s check things out. I wonder what Class C is thinking?\u201d\nWe came out from the bushes and walked to the beach. One of the\nmale students noticed us, and called out to another male student nearby. We\ncouldn\u2019t see his face too well, since he was leaning over in his chair. One of\nthe boys rushed over to us.\n\u201cUm, Ryuuen-san has requested your presence,\u201d he said. Judging from\nthe timidity of his voice, he was either frightened or naturally listless.\n\u201cHe rules his classmates like a king. It\u2019s like a royal welcome. What\nshould we do?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you, Horikita.\u201d\n\u201cFine. I\u2019m interested in learning his intentions. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nWe accompanied the boy. As we approached the ocean, the delicious\nsmell of cooked meat wafted by our noses.\n\u201cThis is absolutely outrageous.\u201d\nOur class didn\u2019t seem to know how to have a vacation. We approached\n", "the man in command of this hedonistic paradise.\n\u201cI thought someone was sniffing around. It\u2019s you, huh? What business\ndo you have with me?\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be doing well for yourself. This looks like quite the\nextravagant party.\u201d\nRyuuen, tanned and clad in his swimwear, laid back in his chair. He\nflashed his white teeth at us.\n", "\u201cJust as you see. We\u2019re enjoying our summer vacation.\u201d\nHe spread his arms wide, proudly showing off the extravaganza.\n\u201cThis is a test. Do you understand what that means? You don\u2019t seem to\nunderstand the rules\u2026\u201d\nRyuuen didn\u2019t seem happy being told about his apparent ineptitude.\nActually, he looked disappointed. \u201cI\u2019m shocked. Does that mean you\u2019re\noffering help even to an enemy like me?\u201d\n\u201cIf the person on top is incompetent, those below him will suffer. This\nis pitiful,\u201d Horikita said.\nRyuuen simply smiled, grabbing the bottle of water placed next to the\nradio.\n\u201cHow many points did you use? To be able to enjoy this level of\nentertainment, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cHmm. Well, I didn\u2019t make a precise calculation,\u201d Ryuuen responded\nguilelessly. \u201cTch. Already getting warm. Hey, Ishizaki. Bring me some cold\nwater, right away.\u201d\nRyuuen poured out his remaining water on the sand, almost in\nprovocation. Ishizaki, who\u2019d been playing volleyball nearly, panicked and\nrushed to get Ryuuen another water. A mountain of cardboard boxes were\npiled up inside the tent, likely filled with food and water. Sakazaki peered\ninto a cooler beside the boxes.\n\u201cAs you can see, we\u2019re enjoying our summer vacation. We\u2019re not your\nenemies. Do you understand?\u201d\nHorikita, finding his behavior incomprehensible, pressed her fingers\nagainst her forehead and wrinkled her brows as if she had a headache.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to warn you. You\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one of us is the idiot? Me? You?\u201d\nRyuuen would accept no insults, and threw them back at Horikita.\n\u201cYou want to try surviving on this deserted island in this shitty heat?\nDon\u2019t joke. Class D, the lowest of all, has to put up with starvation, heat, and\nfutility just to save a measly 100 or 200 class points. It makes me laugh.\u201d\nIshizaki ran over, dripping with sweat as he brought the water. He\n", "handed a cold bottle of water to Ryuuen. However, Ryuuen threw it back at\nIshizaki.\n\u201cI said to bring me cold water. This water\u2019s warm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 B-but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nRyuuen\u2019s pupils were just like those of a snake. Ishizaki\u2019s body\nstiffened. He picked up the bottle and ran back toward the tent.\n\u201cThis test is about perseverance, ingenuity, and cooperation. It would\nlikely have been impossible for you from the start. You can\u2019t even establish a\nsatisfactory plan.\u201d\nThey couldn\u2019t possibly hold on for a week after having spent points so\nlavishly. Eventually, their lives would become hell. The tarps, parasols,\nchairs and other things would become obstacles.\n\u201cCooperation? Don\u2019t make me laugh. People betray each other with\nease. People lie. Relationships built on trust just aren\u2019t viable. You can only\ntrust yourself. If you\u2019ve finished your reconnaissance, leave. But if you wish,\nwe\u2019d welcome you here. You\u2019re free to enjoy yourself, whether it\u2019s to eat\nmeat or play on jet skis. Or perhaps you would prefer to have a different kind\nof fun with me? I can prepare a tent for personal use.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of answer I\u2019d expect to hear from someone who\ndeclared war on us.\u201d\n\u201cI absolutely loathe hard work. Patience? Saving? You must be\njoking.\u201d\nIshizaki returned once again, and handed over another bottle of water.\nRyuuen opened the cap and chugged.\n\u201cThis is the way I do things. No more, no less.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Well then, do as you please. It\u2019s convenient for us, anyway.\u201d\nHorikita had changed her mind. Class C wasn\u2019t going to be our enemy\nhere, so they weren\u2019t a problem.\n\u201cWorking up a sweat in order to evaluate other classes is such a pain.\u201d\nHorikita turned on her heel to walk away, but paused. \u201cThere is one more\npiece of business. You know Ibuki, of course?\u201d\n", "\u201cYeah. She\u2019s a member of our class. What about her?\u201d\n\u201cHer face is swollen. Who did that to her?\u201d\nWhile Horikita was nearly convinced he was the culprit, she\npurposefully asked in a roundabout way.\n\u201cAh. She ran out of here rather suddenly. She went looking for help\nfrom another class in the end? Pathetic girl.\u201d\nRyuuen snorted in disgust, then laid back in his chair.\n\u201cThere are helpless idiots in this world. A ruler doesn\u2019t need\nsubordinates who disobey orders. We determined that I would use our class\npoints to my liking. That\u2019s the fact of the matter. Besides, it\u2019s pointless to\nraise the banner of revolution against the ruling class.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words, Ibuki-san clashed with you when you wanted to spend\npoints.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you could say that. That\u2019s why she got a light punishment.\u201d\nHe made a gesture like slapping someone\u2019s cheek. Ryuuen had indeed\nhit her.\n\u201cAnother boy defied me as well, so I had him driven out. I heard he\ndidn\u2019t die, so he\u2019s probably off somewhere eating grass and insects to\nsurvive.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t imagine that was something you could say about a friend.\nBut now I fully understood. Even if Ibuki were absent during roll call, Class\nC wouldn\u2019t care. That\u2019s why Ryuuen didn\u2019t care about his classmates or\ntrying to find them.\n\u201cYou\u2026used up all your points on the first day, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Horikita\nasked.\nEven if you used all of the 300 points you were given, there wouldn\u2019t\nbe any penalties. The effect was nonexistent.\n\u201cYes, as you said. I used all of our points.\u201d\nHis strategy was to be at zero points to negate negative elements. It was\ncertainly unexpected, but it came at a high price. With no points, Class C\nwould have the lowest rank. Even if they managed to guess every other class\nleader\u2019s identity, they could only achieve a maximum of 150 points.\n", "\u201cIf Ibuki is with you, you\u2019re better off chasing her away. If you shower\nher with your awkward sympathies, you\u2019ll have one extra person to prepare\nwater, food, and bedding for. Anyway, if you can\u2019t deal with it, she can\nreturn here. If she grovels on the ground, I\u2019ll forgive her. I\u2019ve a tolerant\nheart.\u201d\nHe\u2019d forgive her defiance if she returned to being under his control. He\nseemed pretty sure that she would. It would be difficult for Ibuki to live alone\non a deserted island for one week.\n\u201cWhat short-sighted thinking. You\u2019re happy right now using your\npoints, but what are you planning to do after the party\u2019s over?\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha. What should I do, I wonder? Well, I suppose that plain,\nordinary people can only engage in plain, ordinary thinking. You\u2019re desperate\nto protect the points you were given. Looking around for the leaders,\ndesperately holding spots, working up a sweat running through the forest.\nAbsolutely worthless.\u201d\nEven though we\u2019d confronted him with facts, Ryuuen laughed and\nshowed no sign of panic.\n\u201cFine. Let\u2019s head back, Ayanokouji-kun. If we stay here any longer,\nI\u2019m only going to start to feel ill.\u201d\n\u201cSee you later, Suzune.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where exactly you found that out, but do not call me by\nmy first name so casually.\u201d\nRyuuen had clearly done some investigating.\n\u201cWell, I rather like forceful women. I\u2019ll make you submit to me\neventually. When that time comes, it will be the ultimate pleasure.\u201d\nWhen he said that, Ryuuen touched his crotch under his bathing suit,\nclearly to provoke Horikita. Horikita, eyes full of contempt, turned her back\nand walked away. As I started running after her, I stopped to look at a\npassenger boat anchored by the pier. I saw students swimming in the ocean,\nplaying volleyball and beach flags on the shore, celebrating with barbecues.\nAlso, I saw the tent where they were stockpiling food.\nRyuuen seemed content to mock the school rules, apparently.\n\u201cClass C is irrelevant. Their self-destruction will help us.\u201d\n", "\u201cSeems that way. They\u2019ve used up all their points, anyway.\u201d\nEven if they had some saved, it could only be a few dozen at most. The\ntwo students\u2019 absence at roll call would swallow those.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what they\u2019ll do once trouble hits.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, Class C probably won\u2019t face any trouble during this\ntest.\u201d\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they? How can they endure this test without any\npoints?\u201d\n\u201cThat was Ryuuen\u2019s original goal. We were given 300 points as funds\nto enjoy our vacation for one week, which is not at all impossible. No matter\nhow much we economize on our food, we have to give up on luxury items.\nThe school made these rules accordingly.\u201d\nHorikita nodded.\n\u201cSo, we should try to save where we can,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYeah. But Ryuuen\u2019s different. He can\u2019t see past the end of his nose,\nmuch less a week.\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t see past what now?\u201d\n\u201cSuppose the test ended today. What then? Do you think this trip\nwould transform into a perfect vacation?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Well, okay. So what? If you have zero points\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s simple. He\u2019d just do what Kouenji did.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cHis physical condition was poor and he was mentally unstable. In that\ncase, it\u2019s better to just retire. If everyone did that, they could return to the\npassenger boat and go about their lives. That\u2019s what they meant by fully\nenjoying their summer vacation: without hardship.\u201d\nGranted, the school might turn us away if we feigned sickness. 300\npoints were enough to use freely for a one-night, two-day vacation. But\nsooner or later, the bill would arrive.\n\u201cSo he really gave up on the test from the very beginning?\u201d Horikita\nmurmured.\n", "Maybe this was just a theory. Perhaps Ryuuen simply hated\ntroublesome things, or perhaps he wanted to avoid mental exhaustion and\npreserve his physical strength. Or perhaps he wanted to improve morale.\n\u201cThe test is literally about freedom. Ryuuen\u2019s way of thinking is one\nway to approach it. It seems like Ibuki and another student rebelled, and\nbecause of that Class C will lose twenty points a day. Since he knew he\u2019d be\nlosing that many points every day no matter what, he came up with a drastic\nstrategy.\u201d\nSince I didn\u2019t know when Ryuuen had decided to spend all of Class\nC\u2019s points, I could only guess.\n\u201cWe ought to think of a way to get points back without giving up.\nRyuuen is most definitely wrong. I cannot possibly understand him,\u201d Horikita\nsaid.\nI suppose that was true. It was certainly true that we couldn\u2019t predict\nthe actions of Ryuuen, whose plans were likely geared to a very unusual\npurpose, if his words earlier were true. Any rational person would regard\nRyuuen\u2019s bizarre schemes with some anxiety. After we passed the beach, I\nturned back and scanned the shore once more.\n\u201cA zero-point strategy, huh? I see. That\u2019s really interesting.\u201d\nIf we could simply shut down dissenting views from our classmates,\nit\u2019d be a rather interesting method. After all, this test wasn\u2019t just about saving\npoints within our own group. We had to strategize if we wanted to win.\n", "3.3\nIn order to make effective use of the extra time on our hands, we\ndecided to check out how Classes A and B were doing. We went deeper into\nthe forest, past the roots of the big, broken tree, just as Kanzaki had\ninstructed. When I thought on it now, though, the tree looked as though the\nschool had broken it intentionally, to use as a landmark. It hinted that there\nwas a spot just further ahead.\nThe moment we set foot in the deep forest, I noticed a slight change.\nQuite a few students\u2019 tracks stood out on this path, which made it easier to\nwalk. If we simply followed the path, we\u2019d probably arrive at Class B\u2019s\ncampsite. That might be why Kanzaki hadn\u2019t provided a detailed explanation.\nSo far, of all the ordeals on this island, the blood-sucking mosquitoes that\nwent for our arms and legs were the most irritating. Soon, we arrived at Class\nB\u2019s base camp.\n\u201cWell, I suppose it\u2019s just what we\u2019d expect from Class B\u2026\u201d\nTheir way of living was entirely different from ours. Their class had\nmade practical use of their spot, with many trees surrounding a well. They\ndidn\u2019t have enough space to spread out three or four tents, so they\u2019d made\ngood use of the space by putting up hammocks. Despite starting in much the\nsame way, our class had chosen completely different items. I was rather\ncurious about some unfamiliar equipment near the well, but what surprised\nme the most was the atmosphere.\n\u201cHuh? Horikita-san? And Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d\nSomeone called to us, almost as if she\u2019d sensed the arrival of sudden\nvisitors. Ichinose was trying to tie a string around a tree to put up a hammock.\nShe wore a jersey, which really suited her, and appeared lively. Kanzaki sat a\nlittle further away from her.\n\u201cYour class seems to be functioning well, despite obstacles.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, yeah. It was really difficult at first! But we tried a bunch of\ndifferent things, and it worked out. Though the list of chores just keeps on\nincreasing. There\u2019s still a ton of work left,\u201d said Ichinose with a big smile.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if we\u2019re getting in the way.\u201d\n", "\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. That probably sounded like I was trying to drive you\nguys away. I think it\u2019s all right if you hang around for a while. You probably\ncame here to ask me something, right?\u201d\nIchinose welcomed us without any hint of protest. She invited us to sit\non the hammock, but Horikita declined the offer, so Ichinose sat instead.\n", "\u201cI was wondering if it might behoove us to tentatively enter into a\ncooperative relationship, like last time,\u201d Horikita said.\n\u201cI think so, too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, how many points have you used so far? What did you purchase?\nAlso, if you could tell us the value of your tools that would really help. We\nwould disclose information in return, of course.\u201d\nI wondered if Kanzaki could have deduced that information about our\nclass just from this morning. Ichinose, with a grin, took out a manual from a\nbag near her feet. She showed us a white sheet of paper, which itemized what\nthey\u2019d purchased, and read aloud.\n\u201cHammocks. Cookware. Small tent, lantern, and temporary toilet.\nFishing rod, a water shower\u2026 If we combine those items with the food we\npurchased, the total comes to exactly seventy points.\u201d\nExcluding the fact that Kouenji had retired, we\u2019d applied our points\nwith the same rigor as Class B.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a water shower? I\u2019m a little curious about that.\u201d\nFrom the name, I deduced it had something to do with a bath, but since\nit was five points cheaper than the temporary shower we decided it probably\nwasn\u2019t as effective and passed.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go over the situation bit by bit, shall we? Since there are\nvarious places in the woods where we can find fruits and vegetables, we can\ncompensate for deficiencies in points by foraging for food. We can also head\nout to the sea and fish. That\u2019s what I was thinking we\u2019d do for food. We\u2019re\nnot worried about water, since we have a well.\u201d\nHad Class B just naturally obtained those things, like when Kushida\nand her group found all that fruit? Since she\u2019d said the word \u201cvegetables\u201d,\nthey probably had better results than Class D. Ichinose took us to the well,\nand showed us the pulley system used to bring up a bucket of water.\n\u201cAt first we were worried whether the water was safe to drink, but\nwhen we looked around at the surrounding environment and the cultivated\nfood items, we determined that the well must have been all right. To be on\nthe safe side, I tried drinking the water yesterday. I waited for some time, but\nnever got an upset stomach. Starting this morning, we had everyone use the\n", "well to get water.\u201d\nThey hadn\u2019t jumped right in and used the well from the beginning.\nThey\u2019d started using it only after properly checking it out. Most people would\nrather drink from something convenient that could save points.\n\u201cAlso, there\u2019s enough natural water that we can use it for showers.\nThat\u2019s what a water shower is.\u201d\nShe indicated some kind of large apparatus placed next to the well.\nThat explained it.\n\u201cAfter we put water in the tank here, we get hot water in only a few\nseconds. It\u2019s really convenient. We use a gas can for the heat source. When\nwe run out, I plan to request another.\u201d\nHorikita calmly listened to Ichinose\u2019s explanation.\n\u201cDid you already know about them? Water showers, I mean,\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo. This is the first I\u2019ve heard about or used them. The school\u2019s rules\nare rather scary, aren\u2019t they? There weren\u2019t any details in the manual, and we\ncan\u2019t ask the teacher, either. Thankfully we have some kids who are familiar\nwith the outdoors in our class.\u201d\nNext to the water shower was a simple toilet set up with a one-touch\ntent. Nothing seemed to be inside.\n\u201cWe set up this temporary toilet instead of getting a shower room. We\ngot it so that the people who dislike being seen by others when they shower\ncould have privacy. The fabric is also waterproof.\u201d\nSo that\u2019s why it was empty.\n\u201cSo, you don\u2019t struggle with sleeping on the hard ground?\u201d\n\u201cAh, yeah. At first, I wondered what we were going to do, but then we\ntook appropriate measures. Want a look?\u201d\nThe grass crunched underfoot as Ichinose made her way to the tent.\nAfter giving a heads-up to the girls inside, Ichinose lifted the bottom flap.\nUnderneath the tent was a thick bunch of vinyl sheets, which looked to be\nabout two centimeters thick.\n\u201cWhen we paid for the temporary toilet, we were told we had access to\nan unlimited number of vinyl sheets. So I might have asked for too many, but\n", "we received a large number of them. Of course, I don\u2019t want to waste\nresources, so I plan to put any unused vinyl sheets into one sheet, and return\nthem in the end.\u201d\n\u201cBy the way, what precautions have you taken against the heat? For\nsome reason, it feels cooler around here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s because we sprinkle water around. We\u2019ve sprinkled\nwater near our beds, because they\u2019re close to the well. We put some water in\nthe plastic bottles that people drank from, and then everyone carries them\naround so they can sprinkle water efficiently. The water soaks into the soil\nquite easily, and since it takes some time for it to evaporate, the effect lingers\nand removes the heat.\u201d\nIchinose and her class weren\u2019t just relying on tools; they were making\ngood use of their knowledge to improve the campsite. After receiving this\ninformation, Horikita carefully explained our situation. She left nothing out\nin the spirit of fairness.\n\u201cI see\u2026 Having someone retire sounds like it really hurt you guys.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a lot to make us uneasy right now, but we have to try\nand make it through.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Well, can we continue our cooperative relationship? I thought it\nwould be a good idea to ignore the rule about trying to find out the leader\u2019s\nidentity. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI was thinking that we should talk about that, too. If we didn\u2019t have to\nbe on guard with even one class, we\u2019d really appreciate it. As long as you\ndon\u2019t mind, Ichinose-san, I\u2019d like you to accept the proposal.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d\nAfter we reaffirmed our mutual information exchange and resolved to\nstay in a cooperative relationship, Horikita sighed in deep admiration while\nlooking around. There was a feeling of true solidarity here, with no disorder\nat all. Each individual student carried out his or her role. Additionally,\neveryone seemed to be fulfilling their duties happily. Normally, you\u2019d find\nsomeone who hated their job or trying to skip out on it.\n\u201cThis class has fallen in line far better than I could have imagined. I\nsuppose that\u2019s because you\u2019re the one taking command, right?\u201d Horikita said.\n", "\u201cYeah. For the time being, anyway.\u201d\nIchinose had managed to unify her class both in and out of the school.\n\u201cIs there anyone in Class D who can bring everyone together? Is that\nyou, Horikita-san?\u201d\n\u201cNo. We do have a boy named Hirata, though. Everyone in class\nclusters around him.\u201d\n\u201cAh. From the soccer club! I know him, I know him! He\u2019s really\npopular among the girls.\u201d\nHorikita seemed disinterested in talking about Hirata, so she changed\nthe topic.\n\u201cIchinose-san. I\u2019m terribly sorry to keep asking you questions, but we\nwant to confirm Class A\u2019s status. Can you tell us anything that will help us\ncapture their base camp? Even something you know about the area might\nreally help.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re okay with something that might be useful, I can tell\nyou something about their place. However, obtaining information is going to\nbe tough.\u201d\nJust like I\u2019d expected from Class B\u2026or rather, what I\u2019d expected from\nIchinose. She\u2019d already done her research on Class A.\n\u201cJust after you cut through this area, there\u2019s an opening. Turn right and\ngo straight until you see a cave. That\u2019s probably where the Class A base\ncamp is. I went there myself to investigate, but I don\u2019t know for sure. It\u2019s\nbecause they\u2019re so thoroughly defensive\u2026or rather, secretive.\u201d\n\u201cSecretive? What kind of measures has Class A taken?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, seeing is believing. If you take a look yourselves, you\u2019ll\nunderstand right away. Since you two are going to check on Class A, does\nthat mean you already understand Class C\u2019s situation?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. We just went there earlier. They\u2019re doing some unbelievably\nstupid things.\u201d\n\u201cThey seemingly have no intention of taking this test seriously. There\nare five days remaining, and they\u2019ll run out of points well before the test is\nover. I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll be able to change their situation even if they\n", "enter into \u2018point-saver mode\u2019 right away. They\u2019re not even looking for a spot.\nI can\u2019t even begin to understand them.\u201d\nIchinose didn\u2019t seem able to come up with the answer, either.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t use any sly tricks in this test. Ryuuen has most definitely\nspent almost all of their points. They might be having fun right now, but\nthey\u2019re going to regret it later.\u201d\nHorikita deliberately didn\u2019t tell Ichinose about the potential withdrawal\nplan I\u2019d discussed earlier. I didn\u2019t think she was hiding it; rather, Horikita had\nprobably determined that Ichinose would come to the same conclusion\nherself.\n\u201cPardon me, Ichinose-san? I\u2019m sorry to interrupt. Do you know where\nNakanishi-kun is?\u201d asked a male student in a rather reserved voice.\n\u201cI think Nakanishi-kun headed down to the shore. Why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d offer to help. Is that unnecessary?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, not at all. I\u2019m really happy you feel that way, Kaneda-kun.\nCan you head over and follow Chihiro-chan\u2019s group? If you tell them I told\nyou to do so, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Thank you very much!\u201d\nHorikita looked a little perplexed after watching that short exchange.\n\u201cHe sounded incredibly formal for a classmate, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cAh, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA Class C student?\u201d\nI spoke before Ichinose could finish answering. She confirmed with a\nnod.\n\u201cDo you know him? It looks like he had some kind of dispute with\nClass C. He said he\u2019d get by on his own, but I couldn\u2019t just leave him. I\nhaven\u2019t asked him about his situation yet.\u201d\nOne male student had been estranged from Class C because he\u2019d\nsupposedly resisted Ryuuen. It looked as though Class B had taken him in.\nPerhaps he felt ashamed about his situation, hence his offer to cooperate?\n\u201cWe also picked up a student yesterday. Another student who escaped\n", "from Class C.\u201d\nHorikita filled Ichinose in on the details about her meeting with\nRyuuen. She told Ichinose about Ibuki, one of the rebel students, who\u2019d\ndefied Ryuuen for just doing whatever he pleased. She also explained that\nIbuki had been hit. After hearing that, Ichinose\u2019s eyes hardened, as if\nstrengthening her resolve to protect her class.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about time to get going, Ayanokouji-kun. We\u2019ll be a bother\nto Class B if we linger too long.\u201d\nWe all said farewell, and Horikita and I left Class B\u2019s camp.\n\u201cIn general, I think we\u2019re all on the same page, but they\u2019re further\nahead. I can\u2019t deny it,\u201d said Horikita, after we\u2019d left and there weren\u2019t any\nother people around.\nHer words sounded like a declaration of defeat. My impression was the\nsame as hers. There was a big difference between D and B, and not just in\npoints.\n\u201cWell, I guess there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Class B just has\nthose special qualities that Class D lacks.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s their teamwork, right? Class B is the superior class because\nthey\u2019re being led well, so when the time comes to make decisions, they don\u2019t\nfight or break apart.\u201d\nClass D had selfish students like Kouenji, who ran off on his own, and\nno one in our class had the power to step in. Meanwhile, Ichinose had\nbrought Class B together, and there wasn\u2019t a hint of disorder. They had a real\nsense of unity, probably the biggest difference between Classes D and B right\nnow. The longer this conflict continued, the starker that difference would\nbecome.\n", "3.4\nWe saw a cave opening that looked like it cut deep into the\nmountainside, like a demon\u2019s mouth. There were two temporary toilets and\none shower room near the entrance.\n\u201cI can\u2019t really see the inside from here\u2026\u201d\nTrying to confirm what was in the cave while keeping our distance was\nprobably next to impossible. Neither Horikita nor I knew anyone in Class A.\nEven though we intended to sneak around, stay hidden, and gather\ninformation, we wouldn\u2019t get anywhere. I stepped over Horikita and headed\nup the road to the cave.\n\u201cW-wait.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. I mean, it\u2019s Class A, so of course we\u2019re going to be scared.\nThere\u2019s nothing we can do about that.\u201d\nHorikita and I both headed toward the base camp.\n\u201cWhat are you planning? We gain nothing by carelessly exposing\nourselves.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do we gain by trying to peek from our hiding spot? We can\nbarely see, and there\u2019s no one around. There\u2019s not much we can see unless\nwe enter the cave.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully calm, aren\u2019t you? Did you have something in mind?\u201d\nHorikita asked.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t thought of anything. Come on, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, what an unintelligible, half-assed answer.\u201d\nShe glared at me with cold and frightening eyes, but I pretended not to\nnotice. Naturally, some Class A students hanging around the cave\u2019s entrance\ndiscovered us. I thought I could salvage the situation so long as I could see\nthe cave\u2019s interior.\nHowever, inside the cave were several vinyl sheets joined together into\none giant tarp, which blocked my view. I couldn\u2019t see inside at all.\n\u201cWho are you guys? What class are you from?\u201d\n", "This guy was definitely one of the two guys who\u2019d found the cave\nquickly on the first day. Yahiko. The other guy, the sharp-witted Katsuragi,\nappeared to be absent.\n\u201cWe came to snoop. You have a problem?\u201d Horikita responded, in an\nimposing manner. It was like a daring switch had been flipped in her brain.\nShe continued, \u201cI mean, I would\u2019ve thought that since you\u2019re in Class A\nyou\u2019d be clever, but\u2026\u201d\nShe looked at the vinyl covering the cave\u2019s entrance, and let out a\nrather forced sigh.\n\u201cWell, rather than clever, I\u2019d say you\u2019re underhanded. What cowardly\nmethods.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nEven though it was plain to see she wanted to provoke him, Yahiko\nsounded irritated, as if she got on his nerves.\n\u201cI\u2019m Horikita, from Class D.\u201d\n\u201cHah, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re from Class D. You\u2019re a bunch of stupid\nfailures, after all.\u201d\n\u201cStupid, huh? In that case, there\u2019s no harm in us seeing what\u2019s inside,\nright? Or does that make you feel uncomfortable?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all!\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not a problem if we look? You\u2019re in the way.\u201d\n\u201cW-wait! Hey! Wait, I said! Don\u2019t just do whatever you please!\u201d\nYahiko moved in front of Horikita to block her, but Horikita\u2019s words\ncut him off.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to look inside. That itself isn\u2019t a violation of the\nrules, right?\u201d\n\u201cStop screwing around. Class A occupies this spot. Class D doesn\u2019t\nhave permission to use it!\u201d\n\u201cOh? So you occupy this place. I didn\u2019t know that. Is there a device\ninside?\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah. So back off.\u201d\n", "\u201cWell, there definitely aren\u2019t any rules that say we can\u2019t go into the\ncave. It\u2019s certainly true that we cannot use the cave while it\u2019s being occupied,\nbut that\u2019s not the same as the right to monopolize it or anything. We should\nhave the right to look inside, or at least to verify if there\u2019s equipment, right?\nIf we couldn\u2019t do that, then people could just forcibly monopolize every spot.\nThat\u2019s not what this test is about.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d\nHer sharp argument skewered Yahiko without any trouble. Horikita\u2019s\nhair fluttered as she tried to peel off the veil that hid the cave entrance.\nHowever\u2026\n\u201cWhat are you doing? I don\u2019t recall giving you permission to invite\nguests.\u201d\nA particularly tall boy passed behind me and continued walking ahead\nto Horikita. This was definitely\u2026\n\u201cKatsuragi-san! These two came to snoop around our camp! They\u2019re a\nbunch of filthy losers!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating. It\u2019s just vinyl. Show me around a little.\u201d\nHorikita, turning to confront the two boys, didn\u2019t seem scared in the slightest.\n\u201cWell then, it should be fine for you to look inside. However, prepare\nyourself. The moment you touch anything, I will notify the school and report\nyour actions as obstruction toward another class. I can\u2019t guarantee what will\nhappen to Class D as a result.\u201d\nKatsuragi was probably bluffing. There was a very low chance that\nwe\u2019d be disqualified for touching vinyl. And yet, there seemed to be some\ngenuine danger hidden in his words.\n\u201cYou\u2019re forcefully monopolizing control of the spot. The rules don\u2019t\nprotect such actions.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. I cannot argue the point. However, it\u2019s\nsomething of an unspoken rule. You in Class D have a spot by the river.\nClass B has a well. You live in and surround the occupied space, so it\u2019s\nhalfway monopolized. Have you taken any forceful measures in dealing with\ntrespassers to your area?\u201d\nKatsuragi\u2019s calm words stopped Horikita in her tracks.\n", "\u201cOne class occupies one spot. Then, they continue to protect that spot\nso they may obtain points until the end of the test. If you violate this\nunspoken rule, it creates chaos. Naturally, Class A will trespass upon Class\nD\u2019s base in retaliation. We should avoid trouble.\u201d\nIt was possible to ignore what he said, but we couldn\u2019t. Like Katsuragi\nsaid, the other classes had all unconsciously occupied one area each. If we\nbroke that rule, our troubles would grow. Horikita turned on her heel and\nwalked away from the cave.\n\u201cWell, fine. I look forward to seeing the results, and Class A\u2019s\nabilities.\u201d\n\u201cWe are quite capable. We also expect things from you, Class D. By\nwhich I mean, your futile struggling.\u201d\nAfter that short exchange, Horikita had the wind knocked out of her\nsails. If Katsuragi hadn\u2019t appeared, Horikita probably would have stepped\nthrough to the other side of the vinyl sheet.\n\u201cYahiko, don\u2019t respond to cheap provocation. Her goal was to force her\nway in and look around. If you thrust your righteous superiority in their face,\nthe other side will back off.\u201d\n\u201cS-sorry.\u201d\nThey\u2019d stripped Horikita of all other options except retreat. Wonderful,\nwonderful.\n\u201cIt seems like we have to leave Class A alone. We definitely can\u2019t\ninvestigate them.\u201d\nOnce they\u2019d claimed the spot, they hid much of it away behind an\nimpregnable wall. However, despite their efforts, we were able to glean\nsomething from the interaction.\n", "Chapter 4:\nThe Meaning of\nFreedom\nKouenji\u2019s questions weighed on my mind for quite some time. On\nthe third day, I left the base camp before noon and made my way toward the\nforest entrance.\n\u201cAhh, ahh, ahh\u2026 Wh-where are you planning to go now, Ayanokouji-\nkun?\u201d\nSakura was out of breath, her breasts heaving as she breathed. She\nmust\u2019ve been looking for me and given chase.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tie a handkerchief around a tree? Anyway, I thought I\u2019d just\ngo and check something out.\u201d\nI wanted to confirm something much earlier, but didn\u2019t had the time.\n\u201cI-It\u2019s probably not okay for me\u2026to come along, is it? I\u2019d only slow\nyou down, probably, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it better for you to stay back? Won\u2019t it bother you if people start\nspreading rumors?\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me at all. Besides, I\u2026.\u201d\nSakura mumbled so quietly that I couldn\u2019t have heard anything even if\nI\u2019d put my ear close.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be particularly easy, right? I mean, after we went\nthrough all the trouble of coming to this island, I think you should have a\nlittle fun\u2026 Though I\u2019m not one to talk about fun, myself.\u201d I thought I\u2019d turn\nSakura\u2019s offer down with an appropriate excuse. However\u2026\n\u201cTh-this is fun, though!\u201d\nSakura offered more resistance than I would\u2019ve imagined. After her\nsurprisingly forceful reaction, our eyes met in shock. Then, Sakura crouched\nand hid her face.\n\u201cAhhhhh! N-no, that\u2019s not what I meant! Ahh! I mean!\u201d\n", "I had no idea what Sakura was trying to say. All I knew was that she\nwas an interesting girl. It\u2019d be great if she could just show that part of herself\nto others.\n\u201cWell then, how about we go together? But I have a condition. If we\nget into trouble later, you won\u2019t blame yourself. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cReally? It\u2019s okay?!\u201d she cried, still hiding her face with her hands.\nWhat kind of conversation was this? It felt kind of odd to just stay\nsilent as we walked, so I killed some time by bringing up a familiar topic.\nAnything was less awkward than listening to the crunch of our footsteps on\nthe path.\n\u201cAre you getting along well with the other girls? I mean, you can\u2019t\nreally do things alone in this test, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not at all\u2026 We don\u2019t really talk or anything,\u201d Sakura muttered,\ntwirling her hair with her index finger. It was like she felt embarrassed about\nherself.\n\u201cI\u2019m just worthless, really. I can\u2019t do sports, or study. I\u2019m not really\ngrowing as a person in any area.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You\u2019re making progress, Sakura-chan.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Me, progress? Ah ha ha\u2026 That\u2019s not true, though.\u201d\n\u201cIt is true. Maybe you can\u2019t see it, but you\u2019re definitely making\nprogress little by little.\u201d\nI tried to convey that with both words and my attitude. It was really\neffective for people like Sakura, who lacked confidence in themselves. It was\nthe first time I\u2019d appealed to someone from the bottom of my heart like that,\nand I hoped it would resonate with her. Sakura stopped walking and looked at\nme, her eyes trembling. She was trying to discern the true meaning of my\nwords.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll make some friends really soon, Sakura. Then school\nwill become much more fun.\u201d\nWhen our eyes met, Sakura panicked and averted her gaze downward.\nEven the fact that she was able to look at people for just one moment was a\nhuge difference from when we\u2019d first met.\n", "\u201cThat reminds me\u2026 That guy, from the incident before\u2026it seems like\nhe resigned.\u201d\nThe man who\u2019d worked at the electronics store on campus had been an\nextremely passionate fan of Sakura from her gravure idol days\u2026 No, in truth,\nhe was just a stalker. He hadn\u2019t been satisfied with hanging around Sakura\u2019s\nhomepage, and had schemed to meet up with her personally.\n\u201cThank you for everything\u2026 Everything worked out thanks to you,\nAyanokouji-kun.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really do anything. You were saved because you got close to\nKushida, and because Horikita and Ichinose helped out. I was just a\nbystander. Anyway, more importantly, nothing else weird has happened,\nright?\u201d\nEven though the stalker had left the school premises, there was the\npossibility that he\u2019d try and reach out online.\n\u201cNo, everything\u2019s been fine. Actually, I\u2019ve been taking a little break\nfrom the bulletin board, too.\u201d\nThat was for the sake of precaution, most likely. Probably a wise\ndecision.\n\u201cBesides, even though you usually act nervous, you always had this\nreally confident expression when you were an idol.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s because I did the photography myself.\u201d\n\u201cA long time ago? But when you were featured in magazines you\nprobably didn\u2019t take the pictures yourself, right?\u201d\nSakura answered with a wry smile, looking sheepish.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do well, and I also took way more time than the others. A\ncameraman would take pictures of the girls to make sure there were as few\npeople involved as possible. Besides\u2026back then, I was able to bear it\nbecause I made myself empty. It was like I erased myself, eliminated my\nfeelings. But I eventually reached my limit, so I had to take a break.\u201d\nSakura said this all in one go, stopping at the very end to take a deep\nbreath. The incident with the stalker seemed to have left her scarred, but now\nthings were headed in a better direction. A mass of trees waited right ahead of\nus. I went ahead of Sakura, proceeding to the opening of the path just ahead.\n", "The way forward began to get rather steep. Since we\u2019d walked for a\nwhile, I decided it was time for a break. I looked back. Sakura was trembling,\nher shoulders shaking. Maybe she hadn\u2019t thought I was going to look back.\n\u201cHow about we take a short break? It\u2019ll probably take a while longer to\nreach our destination.\u201d\nSakura was probably exhausted after walking such a rough trail for half\nan hour. She looked relieved. I searched for a big tree that could provide\nshade against the extreme heat, and the two of us sat between the roots,\nwhere there was enough space for two people. However, Sakura decided to\nsit a little further away, perhaps due to her reserved nature. But the ground\nwas all rugged and uneven, so it probably hurt her to sit there.\n\u201cSit down over here.\u201d\n\u201cIs that okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course. You aren\u2019t comfortable over there, right?\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d\nSakura, still reserved, plopped down next to me. She sat at such a\ndistance that the sleeves of our gym clothes barely touched.\n\u201cNature sure is amazing, isn\u2019t it? I like to spend a lot of my free time\nout in nature, even if it\u2019s just walking around,\u201d Sakura said.\n\u201cConsidering even Kouenji\u2019s satisfaction, the school has probably been\nreally good about keeping up the place. Normally, an overseas jungle would\nbe more dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we left for the trip, I felt depressed at first. I didn\u2019t have any\nfriends, and I don\u2019t really like traveling. I thought it would be fine if I could\njust stay in my room. If I did that, my life would have been the same as\nalways. But then, all this happened. We were told this was some kind of\ntest\u2026\u201d\nSakura looked up at the sky, her back against the tree.\n\u201cBut now I\u2019m kind of glad that we came here. That\u2019s because I never\nreally had the chance to talk with you like this before, Ayanokouji-kun\u2026\u201d\nTogether, deep in the forest, we were embraced by nature and a feeling\nof serenity.\n", "\u201cI wish we could stay like this forever\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nIn the three days since we\u2019d come to the deserted island, this was the\nlongest time I had been alone with Sakura. I wondered if this was some kind\nof karmic meeting between two friendless people. It didn\u2019t feel like it was\nstrange or pointless. Like Sakura said, I felt like the distance between us had\nshortened a bit. I wouldn\u2019t say we were falling in love or anything, but it was\nlike we\u2019d become friends. This was probably the first time I\u2019d felt a\nrelationship tilt toward friendship.\n\u201cOh\u2026 It\u2019s too bad. If I had my digital camera, I probably could have\ntaken the best photos, but\u2026\u201d\nSakura used her thumb and forefingers to make a frame, and placed\nboth herself and me in the frame several times. Then she made an\nembarrassed face, like she regretted doing so. It was certainly true that a\ncamera was essential for preserving memories. Since Sakura was always\ncarrying her digital camera around at school, I imagined that this moment\nwas probably the perfect photo opportunity.\nPreserving memories, huh? So that was why Ibuki had a digital camera.\n\u201cBut if I\u2019m in the picture, wouldn\u2019t that spoil the scenery?\u201d\n\u201cNo, if you\u2019re in the picture, Ayanokouji-kun, it will be the best\nphoto\u2026 Ah! No! I mean, that is, I\u2019ve never taken a picture with a friend\nbefore!\u201d cried Sakura, shaking her head.\nSakura was absolutely genuine. While we sat side by side, I suddenly\nstared at her. Sakura didn\u2019t notice my gaze at first, but after a long period of\nsilence, she finally did. Our eyes met.\n", "\u201cWh-what?! What is it?!\u201d\n\u201cCalm down. Be quiet.\u201d\nSakura had fallen into a state of panic. I placed my hands on both of\nher shoulders and held her firmly.\n\u201cEek!\u201d\nI brought my body closer to Sakura\u2019s, sidling up next to her. When I\ndid so, Sakura froze like a frog trapped by a snake\u2019s glare. My eyes focused\non her hair, where a bug was crawling around. Even someone like me, who\ndidn\u2019t know a lot about insects, could identify it. People commonly referred\nto it as a \u201chairy caterpillar.\u201d Honestly, it grossed me out.\nThe way its body squirmed and the fact that it had countless legs sent a\nshiver down my spine. It had probably fallen off the tree we were resting\nagainst. What should I do? I thought. If I told Sakura she had a caterpillar in\nher hair, she might panic and start screaming. If the caterpillar got into her\nclothes, that\u2019d be an even worse disaster.\n\u201cSakura, there\u2019s something I want to ask you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWh-what is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026are you okay with bugs?\u201d\n\u201cB-bugs?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Bugs. Like grasshoppers and dragonflies, those kinds of things\u201d\n\u201cN-not at all. I absolutely can\u2019t stand them. Ants either.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Well, all right then.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t point it out here, then. I needed to think of another way. I\nwished I could just quickly snatch it away, but being a city boy, I hated\ninsects, too. Even if I tried to remove the bug with a branch or something,\nSakura would undoubtedly notice.\n\u201cHmm. Anyway, don\u2019t move for the time being, okay?\u201d\n\u201cO-okay. Sure\u2026\u201d\nWith that careful warning, I let go of Sakura\u2019s shoulders. Meanwhile,\nthe caterpillar squirmed like it was starting to go somewhere. I\u2019m sure it just\nwanted to escape, and I had to think of a way to remove it safely.\n", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nAs I tried to come up with a plan, Sakura tilted her head with a\nbewildered look. Perhaps sensing that Sakura\u2019s movement meant danger, the\ncaterpillar frantically tried to escape. Ah, this wasn\u2019t good! Don\u2019t be reckless,\nbug!\nI couldn\u2019t delay any longer. I had to save Sakura even if it meant\nsacrificing myself. With my trembling hand, I courageously reached for\nSakura\u2019s hair. There! I touched the caterpillar, grabbed it quickly, and threw\nit into the bushes. Sakura probably didn\u2019t understand the situation, but I\u2019d\nmanaged to protect her.\n\u201cUgh\u2026I feel like there was something gross on me\u2026\u201d\nAfter our break, we chatted amiably and arrived at our destination with\nthe help of my handkerchief acting as a marker. It had taken less time than I\nthought to get there, only about twenty minutes in total. At any rate, I\ncarefully retrieved the handkerchief and returned it to Sakura, then observed\nthe surroundings from where I thought Kouenji had been standing before.\nNothing in these woods stood out at first glance. There wasn\u2019t anything\nelse here. What in the world had he been looking at?\n\u201cDid you notice something?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cUmm\u2026 What\u2019s different?\u201d\nIf your sense of sight did not work, you had to rely on your other\nsenses.\n\u201cFor the time being, let\u2019s investigate the area, but don\u2019t go too far.\nThen let\u2019s check on each other regularly. If we don\u2019t concentrate, it\u2019s likely\nwe\u2019ll get distracted.\u201d\nWe searched the soil and the big tree\u2019s roots on our knees, and tried\ntouching the lush green leaves and branches above our heads. Our sense of\nsmell was sharp as we breathed warm air through our noses. We also tried to\nopen our ears and listen. We made use of all five of our senses and checked\nthe area thoroughly, careful not to overlook even the slightest change.\n\u201cWha\u2014?!\u201d\nSakura, who\u2019d been searching in the bushes away from me, shrieked in\nsurprise. The bushes were so thick that I could only see part of her body, and\n", "wondered if she\u2019d fallen over again.\n\u201cHey, look! I found something amazing!\u201d Sakura\u2019s voice was full of\neager excitement.\nAs I tried to figure out what she was talking about, I saw a different\nvariety of green leaves sprouting from the bushes. Some yellow parts peeked\nthrough as well.\n\u201cIs this\u2026corn?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems like it.\u201d\nI wondered if the corn only grew in this area. I didn\u2019t know much about\nplants, but it was obvious that this was unnatural. The soil here was a\ndifferent color from the surrounding forest soil, proof that the corn had been\ncultivated artificially. It was also strange because bushes surrounded the corn\non all sides, making it difficult to find due to the weeds.\n\u201cSo, this is what Kouenji saw\u2026\u201d\nHe\u2019d noticed the corn at first glance, and said nothing due to his awful\npride. In any case, I was absolutely certain that school officials had been\ncoming and going on this deserted island. This cultivated spot made that\nclear. I inspected the corn, which was rather beautiful thanks to careful\nmanagement and cultivation.\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice if we brought bags\u2026 We probably can\u2019t, but I\nwonder if we should try taking it all back with us.\u201d\nThere were about fifty ears of corn, but carrying them unaided was\nimpossible. We would inevitably need to make several trips if we wanted to\nbring them all back. I took off my shirt.\n\u201cHuh?! Wh-wh-wh-what are you doing, Ayanokouji-kun?! It\u2019s way too\nsoon for that!\u201d\nSakura dropped the corn as she covered her eyes with her hands.\n\u201cSorry, sorry. I thought it would be okay. Wait, what did you mean by\n\u2018it\u2019s too soon\u2019?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t think a girl her age would mind seeing a topless guy, but\nmaybe I hadn\u2019t showed enough consideration.\n\u201cIf we tie up the openings of my shirt, we can use it as a bag. That way\n", "we could carry more at once.\u201d\nI was afraid that if we left and other classes found this place, they\u2019d\nharvest the corn. I wanted to minimize that risk.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll tell everyone when we get back, and then come harvest more.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nThe unexpected harvest had made both of us gleeful, until we spotted\nsome unexpected visitors.\n\u201cWow. Look, Katsuragi-san! There\u2019s an incredible amount of food\nhere!\u201d\nSakura, her attention focused on the corn, jumped in surprise. She hid\nbehind my back. When Katsuragi saw this, he apologized.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We didn\u2019t mean to surprise you. He had no bad intentions,\neither. Please forgive us.\u201d\nHe shot Yahiko a stern look, compelling him to apologize. Yahiko, in\nlow spirits, apologized. I\u2019d encountered these two before. Katsuragi showed\nno reaction, but Yahiko immediately noticed me.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re the spy from yesterday!\u201d\nYahiko raised his voice, shouting angrily. Sakura once again jumped in\nsurprise and curled into a ball. Seeing this, Katsuragi dropped his tightly\nclenched fist onto Yahiko\u2019s head. We could hear the dull, painful thud from\nwhere we stood.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Katsuragi, from Class A. He\u2019s Yahiko. Since this is the\nsecond time we\u2019ve met, a self-introduction should be fine, yes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Ayanokouji, from Class D. This is Sakura.\u201d\nAfter we\u2019d exchanged a brief greeting, Katsuragi glanced at the large\namount of corn.\n\u201cYou found this. Don\u2019t worry, we have no intention of snatching it\naway from you. But if someone else finds this spot, they\u2019ll likely take it\naway.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. There\u2019s only the two of us here.\u201d\nWe had no choice but to pray that no one else found this place. One\n", "idea was to hide it all, but that didn\u2019t lessen the potential danger.\n\u201cYou idiots. One of you two can stay behind and watch the stuff! Isn\u2019t\nthat right, Katsuragi-san?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t seem to understand the situation, Yahiko.\nDon\u2019t dismiss the danger of moving through the forest alone. It\u2019s difficult\nenough in groups of men, but when men and women are together, no matter\nwhat, there will be certain limitations to what you can do.\u201d\nThat was why Katsuragi didn\u2019t go alone into the forest.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\u201cA-are you serious, Katsuragi-san? But, working together with Class D\nis\u2014\u201d\nYahiko obviously wanted to refuse, but he stayed quiet after Katsuragi\nshot him a sharp look.\n\u201cWe appreciate the offer, but our class told us to be careful. They\u2019ll get\nmad if they find out we relied on Class A for help. I\u2019m sorry, but we have to\ndecline.\u201d\nIt was a lie, but Katsuragi had no other choice but to withdraw.\n\u201cI see. We can\u2019t force you. However, can you trust us? After you leave\nhere, there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll make off with all of this, right?\u201d\n\u201cIn that case, I\u2019d have no choice but to give up what I\u2019m carrying right\nnow.\u201d\nKatsuragi quietly cleared a path. Sakura still looked worried as we sped\naway. Afterward, when Sakura and I returned to base camp, we reported to\neveryone about the corn.\n\u201cWhat an amazing find, Ayanokouji! You too, Sakura! Let\u2019s go get it,\nYamauchi!\u201d\nIke called out to Yamauchi, who was nearby. After spotting Sakura and\nme talking with Ike, Yamauchi dashed over with incredible intensity. He\ngrabbed my arm and shoved me away from Sakura.\n\u201cH-h-hey, you! Why were you all alone and shirtless with Sakura?!\nWhy?! Huh?!\u201d\n\u201cCalm down. This is a misunderstanding, that\u2019s all. We didn\u2019t do\n", "anything.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what kind of delusions Yamauchi was having, but now\nwasn\u2019t the time to get into it with him.\n\u201cI have to go talk with Hirata. Sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI trusted you, Ayanokouji!\u201d\nYamauchi ranted and raved while I went to report to Hirata. Soon\nafterward, we organized students into a team, which departed from the camp\nto bring back the corn. In addition, we set the goal of exploring other places\nand looking for more food. Around one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, everyone\nreturned from harvesting the corn.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of food!\u201d\nThe bag appeared to be absolutely filled.\n\u201cIt was pretty dangerous, though. That guy from Class A, Katsuragi,\nwas nearby.\u201d\nApparently Katsuragi hadn\u2019t made off with the corn after we left.\nInstead, he stayed there so that he could watch us. Whether Katsuragi had\ngood or bad intentions, we didn\u2019t know for sure.\n", "Chapter 5:\nThe Quiet Outbreak\nof War\nOn our fourth day, we reached a turning point. The shouting and\ncomplaining died down and were replaced by the sound of laughter. Along\nwith the corn we\u2019d found, Ike and the others had caught some fish. There was\nno more resistance about drinking the river water, either. Thanks to the fruit\nour classmates had found, we\u2019d saved more points than anticipated, and were\nmaking it through this test.\nCurrently, we\u2019d spent a total of about 100 points, including setbacks\nlike Kouenji\u2019s retirement. If we kept things going like this, we\u2019d end the test\nwith a quite a few points left over. If you looked at the state Class D was in\nbefore, the numbers were simply phenomenal. Even Yukimura, who\u2019d\nresisted the most at the start, had no complaints. Every single person was\nsatisfied with our results.\nI started to get a prickly feeling in my head, which was throbbing. I\nborrowed a ballpoint pen, put it in my pocket along with the folded-up piece\nof paper from before, and left base camp.\nI\u2019d started to figure out more about this test. If I were to break it down,\neighty percent of it was defensive, determining whether your class could\nform cooperative relationships. Therefore, I determined that the remaining\ntwenty percent of the test was offensive, judging whether you had the ability\nto scout around and gather information. However, this 8:2 proportion wasn\u2019t\nreflected in the test results. Rather, that twenty percent influenced the\noutcome even more.\nWe already understood each class\u2019 plans. In that case, we knew what\nwe had to do, which was attack the other classes. So, I began to move toward\nClass A\u2019s area. As Class D was based around the river, Class A had most\nlikely centered their activities around their cave. The true appeal of that spot\nwasn\u2019t just that it offered shelter from the elements; the place itself had\nmeaning.\nAs I wandered through the forest, I heard the faint sound of ocean\n", "waves. I picked up the pace, and successfully pushed through the trees and\ntoward the coast.\n\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d\nI applied the brakes and came to a full stop before a cliff\u2019s edge.\n\u201cI definitely saw something from the ship. It was below here.\u201d\nI spotted several facilities located rather close to the cave. It didn\u2019t\nseem like there was any kind of detour route, but as I walked along the cliff, I\nnoticed a ladder set up in a blind spot. Anyone would\u2019ve missed it upon first\nglance. I grabbed onto the ladder with all of my strength. It seemed sturdy, so\nI used it to climb down to the bottom of the cliff.\nShortly after getting down, I found a small hut. Near the entrance, I\nsaw a device\u2014proof that this was a spot. When I peered through the window,\nI saw fishing tackles. In other words, occupation of this spot meant you\nwould able to catch fish without having to borrow equipment from the\nschool.\nWhen I checked to see whether the spot had been occupied, I saw the\nwords Class A displayed on the device. It seemed they had four hours\nremaining. I didn\u2019t doubt that Katsuragi and the others had come here and\ntaken possession of the area after they\u2019d held down the cave. You wouldn\u2019t\nhave known about the spot\u2019s existence unless you discovered it back when\nwe were on the boat. Since the small hut was located right under the cliff, you\ndidn\u2019t have to worry about anyone in the surrounding area seeing you.\nThe tools inside looked unused. Dust had accumulated on them. I took\nthe map out from my pocket and wrote down some notes about the little hut\u2019s\nlocation. I only wrote down the approximate position, of course. Measuring it\naccurately would\u2019ve taken an insane amount of time.\nAfter I finished marking it on my map, I refolded the piece of paper\nand put it back in my pocket. Since there didn\u2019t seem to be anything else, I\nclimbed the ladder back up the cliff.\n\u201cWhen we circled around the island, I saw a tower over there\u2026\u201d\nWhile scanning the area, I relied on my memory. I shifted my gaze\ntoward the ground that had been trodden on by people. Then I continued into\nthe forest, following the path. Eventually, I reached higher ground. Was a\n", "spot here, I wondered?\nAlthough it seemed possible to look out over the whole beach by going\nup the installed ladder, the facility didn\u2019t seem that useful. It seemed like\nsome spots were better than others.\nI drew closer to confirm the equipment on the wall of the facility.\nUnlike the last place I\u2019d checked, this place didn\u2019t seem to be occupied. The\nfacility itself was rather large, so even though the place was well in the\nbackwoods, it would\u2019ve been easy to find. In other words, that meant I didn\u2019t\nknow who had been monitoring the area. The fact that no one was occupying\nthe tower showed that holding it ran the risk of being observed by the enemy.\nKatsuragi was a cautious man, reliant on solid, secure strategies. He\nwouldn\u2019t carelessly take the bait, even bait this sweet and this close. The\nbushes nearby rustled despite the absence of wind.\n\u201cSo, you won\u2019t occupy this spot out of more than a sense of prudence?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? This place is being used by Class A.\u201d\nTwo guys sprang out of the bushes as if they\u2019d been waiting for\nsomeone to fall into their trap. I was surrounded. One of the guys\nimmediately went over to the terminal to check on its status. He was likely\nchecking to see whether I\u2019d claimed the spot or not.\n\u201cWho are you? I haven\u2019t seen your face before.\u201d\nHe probably wouldn\u2019t know a Class D outcast, a self-proclaimed pill-\nbug who hid under a rock. The guy in front of me brandished a tree branch\nlike a weapon, thrusting it toward my throat. He was trying to threaten me.\n\u201cI\u2019m Ayanokouji, from Class D.\u201d\nOf course, I instantly buckled and offered my name.\n\u201cSearch him. See if he\u2019s got anything suspicious.\u201d\nThey put their hands in my pockets, and even checked my ankles for\nanything hidden, like I was a suspect surrounded by policemen.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an act of violence. Understand?\u201d\nThere was probably only one answer for such a question: to just nod.\nThey searched my body, and took my ballpoint pen and folded-up map.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the pen for? And a hand-drawn map?\u201d\n", "The map had a rough sketch of the island, as well as my notes about the\noccupied points.\n\u201cGive it back.\u201d\nI reached out, but they didn\u2019t offer it. I ended up only grabbing at the\nair.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your goal? Are you acting alone?\u201d\nAs they barraged me with questions, I fell silent. Three seconds, four\nseconds. I cleared my throat.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u201cI see. So you can\u2019t talk about someone in Class D who\u2019s pulling the\nstrings? Is Class D as a whole planning something? Or are only some of the\nstudents plotting?\u201d\nThey asked me a series of rapid-fire questions, like an interrogation.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say. If I did\u2026I may not be able to return to my class.\u201d\n\u201cBeing an underling sounds tough, Ayanokouji. Well, whatever. I don\u2019t\nknow what you were asked to do, but don\u2019t make unnecessary trouble. It\u2019d be\nbetter for you to just quietly sit back at base camp.\u201d\nThey threw the ballpoint pen at my feet, but kept the paper. These guys\nhad no right to issue orders, but they were coercive.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I talk to you about. If you tell us the identity\nof your leader, we\u2019re prepared to offer a generous reward. 100,000 or\n200,000 points.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking for me to sell out my class for money?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re free to interpret my statements however you wish, but I\u2019ve\nmade the same offer to other people. This offer is first-come, first-serve.\nYou\u2019re better off coming forward and telling me right away.\u201d\nClass A\u2019s strategy essentially had no risks. It was a simple method,\nwhich you could implement so long as you possessed an abundance of funds.\nAlthough the possibility of it working was low, you couldn\u2019t dismiss the\npossibility that some students might be dazzled by the money and sell out\ntheir friends.\n\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t believe it. How would you pay someone? We don\u2019t\n", "have any cell phones here, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true we can\u2019t do it now. If necessary, we wouldn\u2019t mind\nwriting a memorandum.\u201d\nIn other words, they intended to sign a contract now, and transfer\nprivate points after the test.\n\u201cA memorandum, huh? Let me ask you something for my own\nreference\u2026 Can you tell me how many points I\u2019d get if I did tell you\nsomething?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends on your attitude.\u201d\n\u201cCould I have someone trustworthy settle things? For example,\nsomeone like Katsuragi. Or perhaps Sa\u2014\u201d\nThe moment I said the former\u2019s name, one of the boys\u2019 expressions\nchanged.\n\u201cWhy did you say Katsuragi?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that Katsuragi is Class A\u2019s representative.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. Sakayanagi is the representative of Class A.\nNot Katsuragi. You can go now.\u201d\nFrom what they\u2019d just said, it sounded like they had no more use for\nme. They made way for me to pass. It seemed like those two guys were\nKatsuragi\u2019s enemies. If that were true, were they working under Sakayanagi\u2019s\norders? Was Sakayanagi the one leading, not Katsuragi? I needed to clarify\nthat.\n", "5.1\nI went down to the beach to check out how Class C was doing, and see\ntheir base camp. Yesterday, this place had been filled with raucous noise.\nNow it was a ghost town.\n\u201cOh wow, this is seriously a surprise! I knew he wasn\u2019t normal, but I\ndidn\u2019t realize to what extent.\u201d\nI heard voices behind me, as two other people arrived.\n\u201cDid you come here to spy around too, Ayanokouji?\u201d\nIt was Ichinose and Kanzaki from Class B. I wondered if they had\ncome here to see how Class C was doing, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of finding food. I was searching around the forest, and\nended up here.\u201d\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s the middle of the day, I think it\u2019s dangerous to be\nrunning around alone.\u201d\nAfter hearing Ichinose\u2019s gentle warning, I nodded in agreement. While\nthe two of them hid in the shade, they\u2019d observed what kind of state Class C\nwas in. As for why they were hiding, well, they had a reason.\n\u201cOh wow, there\u2019s no one around anymore. It\u2019s just like you said,\nKanzaki-kun. Seems like their strategy was to retire.\u201d\nIchinose scratched her cheek and sighed in disappointment.\n\u201cWe thought we could at least find out who Class C\u2019s leader was. Was\nit pointless, though? If they\u2019ve all withdrawn, we won\u2019t be able to find any\nhints.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t Class C already use up all of their points? Even if we found out\nwho their leader is, doesn\u2019t that mean they won\u2019t get a penalty?\u201d\n\u201cThey said that we wouldn\u2019t see any negative effects during the second\nsemester, so our points shouldn\u2019t be able to go below zero.\u201d\nIchinose pursed her lips, looking bored. All we could see in the former\ncampsite was a big empty space. The only thing left was the tent the school\nhad provided. There were some students left playing around in the water, but\n", "it was just a question of when they\u2019d leave.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to compliment a strategy where you use up all your\npoints, but it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter how I look at it, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to work.\nThis test is about stockpiling points so you come out positive. Ryuuen lost\nwhen he abandoned that idea.\u201d\nIchinose and Kanzaki both looked sad as they gazed upon the\nuninhabited beach.\n\u201cSo, trying to find out who their leader is will be incredibly difficult.\nIt\u2019s just impossible. Impossible!\u201d\n\u201cI think that it would be a good idea to see this test through quietly, and\nstick to a solid plan.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Solid strategy is best.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know if those two were lying or telling the truth, but they\nweren\u2019t hiding their plans from me at all. Ichinose and Kanzaki had realized\nthat spying on Class C was meaningless. This was the perfect opportunity. I\u2019d\nreluctantly planned to ask Hirata and Kushida about Sakayanagi, but those\ntwo didn\u2019t seem well informed on the subject. Also, I wanted to avoid the\nstudents in Class D knowing about my movements as much as possible.\n\u201cI just happened to hear a little bit about this, but do Katsuragi and\nSakayanagi in Class A have opposing groups?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s said they really don\u2019t get along. It seems like they\u2019ve quarreled\npretty intensely. Why do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing. Horikita just gave me an order. She said if I had time, to\ngo and find out something. She wondered if this would be our chance to get\nback at Class A. Well, even though it\u2019s said they quarrel intensely, I imagine\nthey\u2019ll come together during the test.\u201d\n\u201cWell, rather than coming together, I think Sakayanagi-san is taking it\neasy during the test. That\u2019s why everyone thinks Katsuragi-kun is the leader.\nRight?\u201d\nIchinose tilted her head, seeking Kanzaki\u2019s opinion. Who could have\nimagined that Sakayanagi would be an absentee?\n", "\u201cKatsuragi is a clever guy. But even though Sakayanagi isn\u2019t around,\nthere probably won\u2019t be anyone under her who\u2019ll put up resistance. They\nprobably wouldn\u2019t do anything to deliberately cause a rift. There wouldn\u2019t be\nany merit in doing so.\u201d\nIf I accepted that story without question, then the two guys I ran into\nbefore were doing exactly as Katsuragi had instructed.\n\u201cYeah. That seems like it\u2019s true. But wouldn\u2019t the students working\nunder Sakayanagi-san be really unhappy? I mean, those two are complete\nopposite types. I would imagine their opinions would be clearly different,\ntoo.\u201d\n\u201cComplete opposites?\u201d\n\u201cLiberal and conservative? Offense and defense? Persecute and\nprotect? Those kinds of things. That\u2019s why they always seem to be clashing\nwith each other. It\u2019s scary to think about Class A going all out in that\nsituation. If they managed to come together, Class A would really\ndemonstrate their true powers.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Well, I\u2019ll tell Horikita later. Ah jeez, she told me to investigate\non my own. She gets flustered working with others. Well\u2026please pretend\nthat you didn\u2019t hear that last part. It\u2019s going to be bothersome if she gets\nangry with me.\u201d\n\u201cHa ha, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll keep it secret. But I have to say, Horikita\nhas a point. Supposing that two people are completely opposed to and in\nconflict with each other, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to end up destroying\neach other. Well, it\u2019s not like we can really do anything at this stage.\u201d\nKanzaki checked his wristwatch to confirm the time, and then\nsuggested to Ichinose that they head back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time for me to look for food. They\u2019ll be angry if I return\nempty-handed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s both be careful not to get hurt. Please don\u2019t do anything\nreckless.\u201d\nI thanked Ichinose for her concern.\n", "5.2\nLet\u2019s go back to before the start of our special test on the deserted\nisland. Let\u2019s talk about the closing ceremonies for the end of the first\nsemester. I was feeling elated, because I was savoring the joy of being able to\nfully enjoy summer vacation for the first time in my life. However, the Grim\nReaper appeared before me with scythe in hand to snatch away my happiness.\n\u201cAyanokouji. I have to talk to you before you leave. Come to the\nfaculty room.\u201d Chabashira-sensei said immediately after homeroom had\nended, before she left the classroom.\n\u201cWhy? Did you do something?\u201d asked Sudou, who was ready to leave\nwith his bag slung over his shoulder.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember doing anything.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. You\u2019re not good or bad. You live a plain, boring, steady life.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you sound all sarcastic?\u201d\n\u201cSarcastic? I didn\u2019t mean to. Did it feel like it?\u201d\nWhat an awful person\u2026 My wounded heart wept bitter tears. I heard\nsomeone call out to me, and supposed it was Sudou, worried about how he\u2019d\nhurt me. He was a good guy.\n\u201cHey, Sudou!\u201d\n\u201cHey, Horikita. Um, well, since it\u2019s summer vacation\u2026are you free?\nMaybe we can hang out a little.\u201d\nSudou was crazy about Horikita, my desk neighbor.\nHe wasn\u2019t worried about me at all.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWell, because it\u2019s summer vacation, you know? It\u2019d be too bad if you\ndidn\u2019t have fun. We can watch movies or go shopping.\u201d\n\u201cHow stupid. It doesn\u2019t matter at all that it\u2019s summer vacation. Why are\nyou even inviting me out in the first place?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Wh-why\u2019? Why are you being so obtuse?\u201d\nSudou scratched his head. He didn\u2019t understand Horikita\u2019s feelings, but\n", "then it was like a switch flipped.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just like that, you know? Right? Guys invite girls out when\nit\u2019s a holiday\u2026\u201d\nAlthough I wanted to see Sudou\u2019s efforts bear fruit with Horikita,\nChabashira-sensei had called for me. It was best to get unpleasant things over\nwith as soon as possible.\n\u201cHey! Where are you going?\u201d Sudou called, stopping me.\n\u201cWhere do you think? I got called over by the teacher, so I don\u2019t really\nhave a choice.\u201d\n\u201cCan you wait just a little? Just a bit?\u201d\nThat expression grossed me out. He grabbed my wrists with his thick,\nmeaty hands and didn\u2019t let go.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna watch me do battle. Be my wingman.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say such nonsense\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBye.\u201d\nWhile we bickered, Horikita finished getting ready to go and stood up\nfrom her seat. She left the classroom without any hesitation. Sudou simply\nwatched her go, completely dumbfounded.\n\u201cDamn. Guess it was useless after all. Well, guess I\u2019ll go do club\nstuff.\u201d\nHorikita\u2019s absence meant I wasn\u2019t needed, so I left. As I arrived at the\nfaculty room, I saw Chabashira-sensei waiting in the doorway.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you called me over.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk inside.\u201d\nMy \u201cincoming depression\u201d meter rose steadily as she met my questions\nwith such short answers. I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d called me here as a joke.\n\u201cYou might expect bad things when you\u2019re asked to come to the\nfaculty room, but contrary to your expectations, it\u2019s a fine place. There aren\u2019t\neyes all around in here. Many things are better said with some personal\nprivacy.\u201d\n", "I noticed that the security camera, which should\u2019ve been installed in a\nroom like this, was missing.\n\u201cSo what did you want to talk to me about? I\u2019m busy planning my\nsummer vacation right now.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny. I thought you didn\u2019t have any friends?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I was exaggerating when I said that. I have at least a few\nfriends.\u201d\nAlthough I could count the number of friends on two hands, the\nquantity wasn\u2019t important. Or at least that\u2019s what they say. Besides, wouldn\u2019t\nit have been just fine if I spent summer vacation by myself?\n\u201cI\u2019ve called you here today because I wanted to tell you my personal\nstory.\u201d\nChabashira-sensei\u2019s story? This was headed in a very different\ndirection. I didn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d called me over by name and wanted\nto tell me her story. Nor did I have any interest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I haven\u2019t talked to anyone about since I had become a\nhomeroom teacher. It\u2019s silly, but please listen.\u201d\n\u201cBefore that, should we have tea? You must be thirsty,\u201d I said.\nI stood up from my pipe chair and opened the kitchenette\u2019s door. No\none was inside, right?\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell this story to anyone else. If you can do that, please return to\nyour seat.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nI closed the door and returned to sit with Chabashira-sensei.\n\u201cHow do I appear to you as Class D\u2019s homeroom teacher?\u201d\n\u201cAnother abstract question, I see. Is it okay if I say I think you\u2019re\nbeautiful?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t even twitch an eyebrow when I made that joke. But I could\nfeel her bloodlust rising.\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Well, if you don\u2019t mind being compared to other teachers, I\nthink you don\u2019t care at all about Class D\u2019s future, and that you\u2019re a cold\n", "teacher with no interest in her students. That\u2019s my answer.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t as friendly as Class B\u2019s homeroom teacher, Hoshinomiya-\nsensei, nor was she as willing to help out her students like Class C\u2019s\nhomeroom teacher, Sakagami-sensei.\n\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s as you say. I won\u2019t deny it. However, the truth is different.\u201d\nChabashira-sensei paused and looked up to the ceiling, as if she\u2019d just\nremembered something.\n\u201cI was once a student at this school. I was in Class D, just like you.\u201d\n\u201cI must say that\u2019s surprising. I would\u2019ve thought you were more\ncapable, Chabashira-sensei.\u201d\n\u201cHuh\u2026 Well, in my time, the class difference wasn\u2019t as extreme. You\ncould say that we were in a four-way battle, not a three-way one. Up until we\napproached graduation in the third semester of our third year, the difference\nbetween A and D wasn\u2019t even 100 points. It was a close battle, where even\none trivial mistake could knock you off balance.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t feel as though she were bragging. Rather, her story felt like one\nof regret.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing someone made a trivial mistake, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It happened rather unexpectedly. Class C went to hell because of\nmy mistake. In the end, my goal of reaching Class A and my dreams were\nshattered.\u201d\nI felt really sorry for her, but having her bring up her past was really\ntroublesome. If anything, it felt uncomfortable.\n\u201cI\u2019m not catching your drift. What does this have to do with me?\u201d\n\u201cI feel that your presence will be vital to reach Class A.\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to say to that? You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d\nI felt happy to have been praised so unexpectedly, but I didn\u2019t know\nhow to answer.\n\u201cA few days ago, a certain man contacted the school directly. He said\n\u2018expel Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.\u2019\u201d\n", "Chabashira-sensei made a complete change of topic. She was getting to\nthe true issue.\n\u201cHe said to expel me? Well, that\u2019s nonsense. I don\u2019t know who it was,\nbut you ignored his request and won\u2019t have me expelled. Right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. We can\u2019t just expel someone on a third party\u2019s whim. As\nlong as you are a student at this school, you are protected by the rules.\nHowever\u2026if you cause any problems, that\u2019s a different story. Smoking,\nbullying, stealing, cheating\u2026 If you cause any scandal, expulsion is\nunavoidable.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t intend to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with your intentions. If I determine that something\nseems like an issue, it will become reality.\u201d\n\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d I found her wording suspicious.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, Ayanokouji. You are going to aim for Class A for me.\nI will follow up as extensively as I can in order to protect you. Don\u2019t you\nthink that sounds like a good offer?\u201d\nI\u2019d thought she had changed a lot from when I first met her, but I never\ncould\u2019ve imagined she would blackmail a student. I laughed.\n\u201cCan I go now? I won\u2019t listen to any more of this.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, Ayanokouji. You will be expelled, and once again,\nClass D won\u2019t reach Class A.\u201d\nHer speech and behavior weren\u2019t just for show. She seriously intended\nto cut me. She was placing her unachieved dreams on my shoulders.\n\u201cLet me ask you once more. Will you aim for Class A? Or be expelled?\nYou choose.\u201d\nWith my left hand, I reached over the desk and grabbed Chabashira-\nsensei\u2019s collar.\n\u201cI remember when Horikita said you made her feel uncomfortable. I\nwonder if she felt like this. It\u2019s like entering someone\u2019s home with shoes on.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Chabashira-sensei, who\u2019d behaved with confidence until then,\nlaughed in self-deprecation. \u201cI surprised myself. I realize now that I still\nhaven\u2019t given up on reaching Class A.\u201d\n", "Her eyes had gotten slightly misty. Her usual cold indifference was\ngone. When she grabbed my left arm, my hand still grasping her collar, I saw\nthe forceful determination had returned to her eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019d thought you would lead Class D voluntarily, but we don\u2019t have\nany time to waste. You have to decide here and now. Will you help me or\nnot?\u201d\nLuke, Star Wars\u2019 protagonist, originally chose to return to his uncle\u2019s\nfarm and reject the call to adventure. However, he was eventually dragged\ninto the horrors of war. That was his destiny. You might say I should\u2019ve\ntaken this woman\u2019s story with a grain of salt. I didn\u2019t know how much of it\nwas true.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll probably regret trying to use me.\u201d\n\u201cRelax. My life is already full of regrets.\u201d\nThat was the troublesome event that launched my summer vacation. It\nwas something I didn\u2019t like to think about. At any rate, I couldn\u2019t lose my\ncurrent school life. Throwing away your freedom in order to protect it\u2026 How\nridiculous.\n", "Chapter 6:\nFalse Teamwork\nWhile I was sleeping, I could hear girls\u2019 voices from outside the tent.\nThey sounded like they were in a bad mood.\n\u201cHey, boys. Can you all gather around?\u201d\nThe voice sounded rough, like she\u2019d meant to say, \u201cHurry and wake\nalready!\u201d I\u2019d just gotten to sleep at dawn, so I rose slowly and rubbed my\neyes.\n\u201cWhat the hell? God, I\u2019m so goddamn tired\u2026\u201d An irritated Sudou\nappeared from the tent and looked around.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hirata asked.\n\u201cAh, Hirata-kun. I\u2019m sorry, but can you please wake all of the boys?\nIt\u2019s serious,\u201d said Shinohara, sounding apologetic.\nWhether she was flustered or angry, the issue didn\u2019t seem to be hers\nalone. A little further away, the girls glared at us.\n\u201cI understand. I think if I shout, they\u2019ll come.\u201d\nWithin two minutes, the boys came out of the tent rubbing their sleepy\neyes. When the half-asleep boys looked around, they inferred that this\nsituation was especially alarming. The girls all looked unusually scared.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did you wake us up so early?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Hirata-kun. This doesn\u2019t involve you, but\u2026we\u2019ve gathered\neveryone to confirm something.\u201d\nShinohara gave everyone except Hirata a look of complete contempt.\n\u201cWell, this morning\u2026Karuizawa-san\u2019s underwear went missing. Do\nyou know what this means?\u201d\n\u201cU-underwear?\u201d\nEven Hirata, usually calm and collected, appeared visibly shaken.\nSpeaking of Karuizawa, she was missing, along with some of her friends.\n", "\u201cKaruizawa-san is crying inside the tent right now. Kushida-san and\nothers are comforting her right now, but\u2026\u201d Shinohara looked over to the\ngirls\u2019 tent.\n\u201cHuh? Huh? What? Why are you glaring at us over her underwear\nbeing missing?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? Someone went through her bag in the middle of the\nnight and stole them. Our luggage was outside the tent, so if someone wanted\nto steal something, they easily could have!\u201d\nThe boys, still in a state of drowsiness, all exchanged looks.\n\u201cNo, no, no, no! Huh?! Huh?!\u201d\nIke, in a complete panic, looked back and forth between the boys and\ngirls. One of the boys who\u2019d been observing all this grumbled calmly.\n\u201cCome to think of it, Ike, you were pretty late getting back from the\ntoilet yesterday. You took a really long time.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no! That was just, well\u2026I was struggling because it was\ndark!\u201d\n\u201cIs that so? You stole Karuizawa\u2019s underwear, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cY-you\u2019re wrong! I didn\u2019t do it!\u201d\nThe boys started blaming one another for this particularly nasty crime.\n\u201cAnyway. This is a huge problem, don\u2019t you agree? It\u2019s impossible for\nus to camp alongside a bunch of underwear thieves,\u201d said Shinohara, her\narms crossed. She looked as though she was going to lose her temper.\n\u201cHirata-kun, can you find the culprit?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no evidence that the boys stole it. Maybe Karuizawa lost\nit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right! We have nothing to do with this!\u201d The boys\nshouted behind Hirata, proclaiming their innocence.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think there\u2019s a criminal among us.\u201d\nDoubting our classmates seemed wrong.\n\u201cI know that you\u2019re not the culprit, Hirata-kun. But for the time being,\nlet\u2019s check the boys\u2019 luggage.\u201d\n", "Apparently, the girls weren\u2019t changing their minds on this. They had\ndecided that the culprit was on the boys\u2019 side. Well, I supposed that it was\nonly natural to think that.\n\u201cHuh? Don\u2019t give us that crap. We don\u2019t need to do that. Hirata, tell\nthem no.\u201d\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019ll try gathering the guys together and talking it out. Can\nyou please give us a little time?\u201d Hirata asked.\n\u201cIf you say so, Hirata-kun. I understand. I\u2019ll try talking to Karuizawa-\nsan. But if the culprit can\u2019t be found, we have some ideas.\u201d\nWith that, everyone scattered. Hirata quickly gathered all the boys in\nfront of the tent.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just ignore what the girls said. I hate being treated like a suspect.\nI\u2019ll fight it!\u201d\nIke had managed to get some degree of trust from the girls on the first\nday, but apparently it wasn\u2019t meant to last. It was only natural that the boys\nwould be unhappy about being unjustly accused.\n\u201cExactly. It\u2019s not like we stole Karuizawa\u2019s underwear or anything.\u201d\nYamauchi exchanged looks with everyone individually. It wasn\u2019t as\nthough Karuizawa wasn\u2019t cute or anything, but since Karuizawa was Hirata\u2019s\ngirlfriend, it would\u2019ve been a much better idea to go after Kushida and\nSakura.\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you guys, but we won\u2019t solve the problem like this.\u201d\nThe girls, who were talking together in their cliques, looked like they\nwere about to jump on us.\n\u201cIt might be better to just accept the baggage inspection with dignity\nand prove your innocence.\u201d With that, Hirata brought out his own bag.\n\u201cAs miserable as this might be, I think you guys\u2019ll have to do it. Are\nyou okay with that?\u201d\n\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll open up my luggage first,\u201d Hirata said.\nIn order to get us all to move, he had no choice but to take action. Still,\nthere probably wasn\u2019t even one person here who thought Hirata was the\n", "culprit. Besides, you could say that stealing his own girlfriend\u2019s underwear\nmade no sense. However, if one person opened his luggage, then the rest of\nus couldn\u2019t help but follow. Inevitably, the students who wouldn\u2019t open their\nbags would be suspected. Hirata\u2019s bag naturally didn\u2019t have the underwear.\n\u201cGuess we don\u2019t have any choice\u2026\u201d\nAll the other boys began pulling bags out, one after another. Ike and\nYamauchi hated it, but couldn\u2019t resist being pulled in. The three of us were\nthe last to go. I reluctantly headed into the tent, following after Ike and\nYamauchi.\n\u201cDamn, I\u2019m so pissed. Men are always being suspected of stuff. It\u2019s\nway too unreasonable.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s prove our innocence.\u201d Ike grabbed his bag, but suddenly\nfroze.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing\u2026\u201d\nHe turned his back on Hirata and the others, checked the inside of his\nbag, and frantically closed it back up.\n\u201cKanji?\u201d\nIke\u2019s face was pale, his body stiff. He was completely paralyzed. \u201cHey,\ncome on. Let\u2019s hurry and get going.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re the one that really stole them?\u201d said Yamauchi, half-\njokingly.\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s crazy talk!\u201d\nIke frantically denied it, shaking his head while clutching his bag.\nWhat a blatant overreaction. We weren\u2019t dumb enough to believe nothing\nwas wrong.\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d Yamauchi said.\n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t believe me?!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that. Show me what\u2019s in your bag.\u201d\n\u201cAh, wait!\u201d\nYamauchi snatched Ike\u2019s bag to check inside. When he did, he saw\u2026\n", "white underwear, definitely not a man\u2019s, balled up and hidden.\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s not mine! Someone put it in my bag or something,\nsomehow!\u201d\n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t give me that excuse\u2026\u201d\nYamauchi looked at Ike with pity.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t know how it got there! Why would there be\nunderwear in my bag?!\u201d\n\u201cThis is shameful. Let\u2019s go explain things to Hirata and the others.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?! But if I do that, they\u2019ll make me out to be the culprit!\u201d\n\u201cThere was no culprit\u2026right?\u201d\nWhy was Yamauchi asking Ike? Ike had Karuizawa\u2019s underwear in his\nbag, making Ike the culprit, right? Putting aside when and how he stole the\nunderwear, the thief likely wouldn\u2019t have hidden the stolen goods in his own\nbag. It was obvious that in the case of an uproar, a search for the criminal\nwould begin. If Ike was really guilty, he should\u2019ve been panicking when he\nwas told to open his luggage. But I hadn\u2019t seen the slightest hint of that.\nI concluded that someone other than Ike was the culprit, and that\nperson had planted evidence to frame Ike. Unless Ike really was that stupid\nand simple\u2026but he couldn\u2019t be, right?\n\u201cAyanokouji, you believe me, right? That I didn\u2019t steal them?!\u201d\n\u201cWell, if I think calmly, no solid evidence suggests you\u2019re the culprit,\nIke.\u201d\n\u201cAyanokouji!\u201d he cried.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that Ike is the culprit. If he were, this would be far too\nstupid of him.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that sounds right, but\u2026 Wait, what? You mean someone put the\nunderwear in Kanji\u2019s bag?\u201d\n\u201cWe just have to figure out who!\u201d Ike cried.\n\u201cHey, hurry up!\u201d one of the boys by Hirata cried.\n\u201cWh-wh-wh-wh-what am I gonna do? I\u2019m in serious trouble!\u201d\n", "If the stolen item were found here, the girls would probably determine\nthat Ike was the culprit.\n\u201cWe have no choice but to hide them. Now.\u201d\n\u201cHide them? Where?! We can\u2019t hide them!\u201d\nIt was certainly true that we currently lacked storage options. If the\ngirls saw us hurry to the toilet or into the tents, they\u2019d become suspicious and\ndemand to search that area. Most importantly, we were spending too much\ntime in here. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if we were already under suspicion.\n\u201cWe have no other choice. You have to put it in your pocket.\u201d\nThat was the only advice I could give. There wasn\u2019t any time to hide\nthe underwear anyplace else, and we didn\u2019t want to draw attention to\nourselves.\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t do it! I-I\u2019m already panicking!\u201d\nStill, hiding the underwear was our only option.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you, Ayanokouji!\u201d\nIke removed quickly thrust the balled-up underwear into my hands.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cIf you think it\u2019s better to hide them, you can do it. Right?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHey, hurry up!\u201d someone called.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming now!\u201d\nIke muttered, \u201cI\u2019m counting on you,\u201d and scurried off. Yamauchi, not\nwanting to get dragged into it, quickly apologized and hurried away.\n\u201cHey, are you serious?\u201d\nI broke out into a cold sweat. The longer I stayed, the worse this would\nget. If I\u2019d had a minute, I\u2019d have hidden it someplace difficult to find, but\nthere was no time. Impulsively, I stuffed the underwear into my back pocket,\ntook my bag, and headed back to the others.\n\u201cSorry, sorry. My bag got a little dirty, so I cleaned it off.\u201d\nWith that excuse, Ike tossed over his luggage.\n", "\u201cSearch it if you gotta. I\u2019m innocent. Right, Yamauchi?\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d\nThe two proudly placed their bags down. Hirata, after lightly declining\nthe duty, inspected the inside of the bags. I also set my bag down and moved\naway. After everyone\u2019s luggage had been inspected, Ike called over\nShinohara, who was waiting with her arms crossed.\n\u201cWe searched everyone\u2019s bags. None of us did it.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no doubt. None of the boys are the culprit.\u201d\n\u201cWait a moment.\u201d\nShinohara drew nearer and checked the inside of the tent. She seemed\nsuspicious, as though we\u2019d hidden something. Of course, there wasn\u2019t\nanything there. After inspecting the two tents, Shinohara went back to the\ngirls once again and discussed the situation.\n\u201cHey, Hirata-kun. Could they have hidden it in their pockets? Ike-kun\nand Yamauchi-kun, and even Ayanokouji-kun were whispering a little\nearlier. It\u2019s got me curious.\u201d\nOf course we were being sneaky. The girls had demanded to check\nevery nook and cranny.\n\u201cJeez, enough is enough!\u201d Ike cried.\nThe girls began to attack him.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t Ike-kun acting all suspicious earlier? Maybe he is hiding\nsomething after all?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?! I-I\u2019m not hiding anything! Search me if you gotta!\u201d\nHe spread his arms wide as he proclaimed his innocence. Hey, Ike\u2026 If\nyou tell them to do that, then\u2026\n\u201cLet\u2019s search him. Hirata-kun, can you do it?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. If it convinces the girls, fine. However, if I don\u2019t find anything,\nI want you to stop investigating the boys.\u201d\nThis was the worst possible outcome. While the girls watched Ike,\nYamauchi, and me, the pat-down commenced. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t find\n", "the underwear on either Ike or Yamauchi. They kept still throughout Hirata\u2019s\ncareful search, and he checked them thoroughly. Finally, it was my turn.\nIt was already too late to escape. Perhaps it was better that it was me.\nNo, that wasn\u2019t true. There wasn\u2019t anything I could do now. Hopefully Hirata\nmight overlook it, even if there was only a one percent chance he would. I\ndecided to be perfectly still, like a dead fish.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019ll be over soon,\u201d Hirata said.\nHirata, who didn\u2019t doubt me whatsoever, slowly started to search me,\nstarting with my upper body. Then, Hirata put his hand into my back pocket,\nwhere I\u2019d stuffed the underwear.\nIt was all over, wasn\u2019t it?\nI resigned myself. I felt Hirata\u2019s hand touching the underwear. Well, I\ncouldn\u2019t be completely sure Hirata was touching was the underwear, but I\nsuspected he was touching that rolled-up piece of cloth in my pocket. Hirata\u2019s\nbody stiffened, and he looked me in the eyes. After a brief glance, Hirata\nexamined my jersey without taking the underwear out of my pocket.\nFinished, he turned back toward the girls.\n\u201cAyanokouji-kun doesn\u2019t have them either.\u201d\nHe walked toward Shinohara. Ike and Yamauchi exchanged shocked\nlooks.\n\u201cThose three didn\u2019t take them.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026 I thought for sure it was one of them. But if you say\nso, Hirata-kun\u2026\u201d\nIf the overwhelmingly honest Hirata said something, Shinohara had no\nchoice but to believe him.\n\u201cIt should be fine once I tidy up the luggage. We can discuss it more\nafter.\u201d\nAfter the inspection had come to an end, I hurried back inside the tent.\nHirata followed me.\n\u201cHirata. Why didn\u2019t you tell them?\u201d I asked, straight out.\n\u201cThat was the underwear in your pocket, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n", "\u201cDid you\u2026take Karuizawa\u2019s underwear, Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nHow would this fine young man respond to my denial?\n\u201cI believe you. You\u2019re not that kind of person. But why did you have\nthem in your pocket?\u201d\nThere was no way I couldn\u2019t tell him the truth after he said that he\nbelieved me. I told him they came from Ike\u2019s bag. Hirata looked momentarily\nlost in thought.\n\u201cI see. So it definitely wasn\u2019t you. But I don\u2019t think Ike-kun or\nYamauchi-kun did it, either. If they were the culprits, they probably wouldn\u2019t\nput the underwear in their own bags. They would have hidden it in another\nplace.\u201d\nHirata\u2019s usual quick-wittedness had saved me. I didn\u2019t need to go to the\nbother of trying to explain.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all right with you, may I hold onto the underwear?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cSure, but\u2026is that really all right?\u201d\nHolding the underwear was exactly like holding the Joker in a deck of\ncards. They were both trouble to deal with.\n\u201cIn the worst-case scenario, if I\u2019m made out to be the culprit, I would\ntake the least amount of damage. I am her boyfriend, more or less.\u201d\nAfter saying that, he took one of the vinyl toilet bags and put the\nunderwear inside. I wondered if it would be painful for Karuizawa to know\npeople were touching her underwear with their bare hands.\n\u201cBut we did find out one piece of bad news here. If the underwear\ncame out of Ike-kun\u2019s bag, then there\u2019s a high chance that the culprit is\nsomeone in our class.\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\nNo matter how you looked at it, if a student from another class had\nbeen loitering around, we would\u2019ve seen them. After exiting the tent, I\nscanned my surroundings. Our bags were individually wrapped in vinyl and\nplaced in front of our tent. The girls\u2019 tent was a few meters away, where\nKaruizawa and the others slept. Until this whole incident, the girls\u2019 luggage\n", "had been piled up out front, unprotected, like ours. If you wanted to steal\nsomething, you easily could do so. I was easily able to rifle through Ibuki\u2019s\nbag on the first day.\nWhen had the underwear been stolen? Since there were no problems up\nuntil it was time to take a shower, the crime had happened sometime between\neight o\u2019clock last night and seven o\u2019clock this morning. If that were the case,\nanyone in our class could have done it. However, I doubted that the crime\nhad been carried out in the middle of the night. If the culprit were rifling\nthrough luggage with a flashlight, someone would have noticed.\nIn that case, it was very likely that the crime had been carried out\naround sunrise, after five o\u2019clock in the morning. Even if I\u2019d narrowed down\nthe crime\u2019s timeframe, it was still difficult to narrow down the list of culprits.\nWhat if I tried changing my perspective? Say Karuizawa stole her own\nunderwear and hid it in Ike\u2019s bag. But what reason would she have for doing\nthat?\n\u201cI believe you\u2019re not the culprit, Ayanokouji-kun. That\u2019s why I saved\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cO-oh. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all I want to say. I want you to help me find the real\nculprit, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d\nHirata took my hand as he made his request.\n\u201cYou want me to find the culprit?\u201d\n\u201cI think people, both guys and girls, will be uneasy until the thief\u2019s\nfound. To be honest, it would probably be best if I found the culprit, but it\nlooks like it\u2019ll be difficult to get everyone together\u2026\u201d A class star like Hirata\nhad certain restrictions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be easy to find someone who would hide things in\nIke\u2019s bag.\u201d\nHirata should have known that finding the criminal would be difficult.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do what I can. Just don\u2019t expect too much of me.\u201d\n\u201cThank you! Thank you, Ayanokouji-kun!\u201d said Hirata, almost\nhugging me and bowing his head deeply. I understood Hirata was thankful,\nbut felt his reaction was a bit excessive. Perhaps the underwear theft was\n", "really bothering him, in particular. As a leader, he had to respond seriously to\nthe crisis and try to find a resolution for the class.\n\u201cIf you do happen to find the culprit, I want you to tell me first. I\ndefinitely do not want you to tell anyone else.\u201d\nHis ability to widen his eyes while making such a sincere appeal pretty\nmuch destroyed my ability to say no. He looked almost too calm. It was a\nlittle eerie.\n\u201cIf that information becomes public knowledge, our class will suffer a\nhuge blow. I want to avoid that. That\u2019s why I want to find a peaceful method\nof settling things with the culprit. If it\u2019s coming from me, I think that we\u2019ll be\nable to resolve the issue through talking.\u201d\n\u201cSo, in other words, you\u2019re going to hide the truth?\u201d\n\u201cHide it? That\u2019s a poor choice of words, but there\u2019s nothing I can do\nabout it if people take it that way. Even if one of the guys turns out to the be\nthe culprit, I think it\u2019s better that the truth be concealed.\u201d\nHe focused on me. It was almost as if he meant to protect the culprit.\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll report to you first. Is that good?\u201d\n\u201cThank you. Well then, I\u2019ll be getting back to work.\u201d\nUpon exiting the tent, Hirata called out to the other students. I saw\nmultiple silhouettes on the other side of the sheet begin to recede.\n\u201cHirata Yousuke. Are you Class D\u2019s hero?\u201d\nThere was one contradiction in Hirata\u2019s story. Right after he said he\nbelieved in me, he immediately said the truth ought to be concealed even if\nthe culprit was one of the guys. In other words, even if someone had the\nunderwear, we\u2019d hide it from the girls.\nHirata didn\u2019t have complete trust in me. He probably assumed there\nwas a high chance I was the culprit. That was only natural, of course. From\nan outsider\u2019s perspective, I was the one holding the underwear, and I\u2019d\noffered up Ike\u2019s name as the culprit. Hirata assigned me, a potential suspect,\nthe role of detective to offer me a lifeline. At the same time, he\u2019d issued a\nwarning not to commit the offense a second time.\nThinking this way, I was able to get a grasp on the story. I was certain\n", "6.1\n\u201cCould everyone please gather around?\u201d\nWhen I exited the tent, Hirata\u2019s meeting had begun. I saw Karuizawa\ntrembling with anger, her eyes puffy and red.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust the guys. It\u2019s absolutely impossible for us to stay in the\nsame place as them!\u201d\n\u201cBut there would be problems if the guys and girls lived apart, don\u2019t\nyou think? The test is almost over. Because we\u2019re all friends, we need to\nbelieve in and cooperate with one another.\u201d\n\u201cYou might be right. But we can\u2019t stand being in the same place as\nunderwear thieves!\u201d\nKaruizawa shook her head, dismissing the notion as impossible. If the\nvictim said so, Hirata couldn\u2019t really force her. Shinohara took a tree branch\nand drew a line.\n\u201cWe think the culprit is a boy, so we\u2019re drawing a dividing line\nbetween boys and girls. Boys are absolutely prohibited from entering our\nside.\u201d\nShinohara\u2019s proposal was gender-based separation to an extreme.\n\u201cWhat the hell? You\u2019re just arbitrarily treating us like criminals. Didn\u2019t\nwe let you check our bags and give us pat-downs?\u201d\n\u201cIt might not have been hidden in a bag, though. Men are perverts.\nAnyway, don\u2019t enter the girls\u2019 territory until the culprit has been found. Go\nover there.\u201d\nWith that, she demanded that the boys move their tent. As expected,\nthe guys were not convinced. Booing commenced.\n\u201cIf you doubt us, then move your own tent. We\u2019re not moving ours,\nand we\u2019re not helping you, either.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I see. Yeah, you only pretended to help out while you fished\nthrough our luggage.\u201d\n\u201cOh, and you aren\u2019t allowed to use the shower anymore. We\u2019re not\n", "joking. We\u2019re not about to let a perverted thief use it.\u201d\nOur class unity had completely broken down.\n\u201cHeh. Can you guys even drive in the tent stakes?\u201d\nShinohara, feeling like the situation was taking a turn, looked to Hirata\nto save them.\n\u201cHey, Hirata-kun. Can you help us, for Karuizawa-san\u2019s sake?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll help. It might take some time, though. Is that okay?\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Hirata-kun. Aren\u2019t you glad, Karuizawa-san?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Hirata-kun is the only one we can trust.\u201d\nKaruizawa, looking happy and a bit bashful, blushed.\n\u201cHeh. Hirata might even be the culprit.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Hirata-kun is not  the culprit. What a stupid thing to say. Why\ndon\u2019t you go jump off a cliff?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Don\u2019t give me that crap, Karuizawa. Just because he\u2019s your\nboyfriend doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not the culprit!\u201d\nNaturally, more and more complaints came from the guys, but their\nwords fell on deaf ears. Everyone except for Hirata was a suspect, so there\nwasn\u2019t anything to be done about it. We quickly reached an impasse, with\nKaruizawa and Shinohara in complete control.\n\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019d like to raise an objection\u2014especially against you,\nKaruizawa-san.\u201d Horikita spoke up, calmly and firmly opposing Karuizawa.\n\u201cWhat is it, Horikita-san? Are you not satisfied with what we\u2019re\nsaying?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t particularly mind dividing up the living areas for men and\nwomen. As long as the culprit hasn\u2019t been found, it is certainly a good idea to\nkeep our distance from the men, considering the likelihood that the culprit is\namong them. However, I don\u2019t trust Hirata-kun. I cannot dismiss the\npossibility that he might be the underwear thief. Also, I\u2019m unconvinced that\nhe should be excluded from the ban on men.\u201d\n\u201cHirata-kun would never do such a thing. Can\u2019t you at least understand\nthat?\u201d\n", "\u201cThat\u2019s just your personal belief, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t force your way of\nthinking on me.\u201d\nKaruizawa stepped closer to Horikita, looking like she didn\u2019t approve\nof Horikita\u2019s attitude.\n\u201cHirata-kun is definitely not the culprit. You don\u2019t even have friends,\nlet alone a boyfriend. You probably wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself. Nothing you can say will convince\nme.\u201d Despite provocation, Horikita was unperturbed, responding in a\ndetached manner.\n\u201cWell, let me ask you something. Would you say there are no other\nguys as trustworthy as Hirata-kun? Or are there?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t speak impulsively. Simply put, I would be fine if you\nincreased the number by one more guy. If you did, they\u2019d be effective in\nwatching each other\u2019s backs.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke. My underwear was stolen, right? I\u2019ve been\nhumiliated! Don\u2019t you understand? I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do when the\nculprit is found.\u201d\n\u201cMight this be happening due to your na\u00efve handling of crisis\nmanagement? Maybe there is an ulterior motive for stealing the underwear\nthat we don\u2019t yet understand.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the heck do you mean, crisis management?! We searched\neveryone\u2019s bags. What\u2019s na\u00efve about that?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that your underwear was stolen. That kind of thing\nhappens every day, and there\u2019s nothing you can really do about it. It\u2019s likely\nsomeone here bears a grudge against you.\u201d\nHorikita was considering the possibility that the culprit\u2019s ultimate goal\nhadn\u2019t been Karuizawa\u2019s underwear. The culprit wanted to lash out at\nKaruizawa and deliberately humiliate her. Horikita was free to reason things\nout as she liked, but wasn\u2019t airing that idea out in public in front of\nKaruizawa kind of a bad move? I suppose you could call socializing\nHorikita\u2019s weak point. She was smart, but had difficulty relating to other\npeople.\nIf Karuizawa were provoked in front of such a large crowd, she\u2019d grow\n", "more hurt and irritated. Then, her ire wouldn\u2019t be directed at just the boys,\nbut probably at Horikita, too.\n\u201cListen here, you!\u201d Karuizawa looked like she was on the verge of\nlosing her temper, until Hirata jumped out beside her in a dashing manner.\n\u201cKaruizawa-san, it would be great if we could have another guy here\nhelp me out. Is that okay?\u201d He\u2019d adopted the role of mediator once again.\n\u201cB-but\u2026how can I trust anyone other than you, Hirata-kun?\u201d\n\u201cHow about me?\u201d asked Ike, raising his hand.\nHe\u2019d just been fighting with Shinohara, and now he was raising his\nhand?\n\u201cWait. If it\u2019s physical work, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Sudou quickly raised his hand.\n\u201cWait. If you\u2019re looking for the guy with the skills, then I\u2019m your\nman!\u201d said Yamauchi.\nNo matter how heated their arguments with the girls, they couldn\u2019t help\nbut want to get closer to them.\n\u201cS-stop joking around. We can\u2019t just casually invite a pervert to help\nus. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of you were the culprit. Or do you think\nthese guys are okay, Horikita-san?\u201d\n\u201cI agree with you. Considering how these three behave on a daily basis,\nthey are completely untrustworthy. I\u2019ve thought it over very carefully, and I\nintend to choose someone who can\u2019t be the culprit.\u201d\n\u201cWho? Is there someone other than Hirata-kun?\u201d\nI regarded the male students. Was there any guy who could put her at\nease, next to Hirata? Yukimura was brilliant, but had his share of disputes\nwith the girls. Who could it be?\n\u201cYou. Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d\nHuh? Why me? How  me? My mouth fell open, and I stood there,\nflabbergasted.\n\u201cHa ha ha! Don\u2019t make me laugh. He\u2019s your only friend, isn\u2019t he?\nThere\u2019s absolutely no way I can trust such a gloomy, lecherous wallflower,\u201d\nKaruizawa said.\n", "I didn\u2019t especially care what people thought about me, but it seemed\nlike many had written me off as \u201cthat guy\u201d or \u201ca gloomy lecher.\u201d Was this\nthe pathetic fate that awaited a loner who couldn\u2019t even make friends in his\nfirst semester of school?\n\u201cIf anything, I think Ayanokouji-kun is the culprit. He was acting all\nsneaky this morning, which was pretty suspicious.\u201d\nUpon finding the underwear in Ike\u2019s bag, I had been pretty inefficient\nand slow. Well, it was true that I\u2019d had Karuizawa\u2019s underwear in my hands\nat the time, which did make me pretty suspicious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026 Ayanokouji-kun was at the bonfire until late last\nnight\u2026\u201d\nThe girls\u2019 doubts had intensified, and I had become their next target.\nDoubters began to appear from the boys\u2019 side, too. Ike and Yamauchi feigned\nignorance. Even if I stayed silent or tried to explain, the situation was going\ndownhill. I opted to just keep silent. No matter how much the girls doubted\nme, Hirata was holding the evidence, and wouldn\u2019t make me out to be the\nculprit. However, despite knowing the truth, being suspected certainly felt\nterrible.\n\u201cAyanokouji-kun really is the underwear thief, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s not\nmaking any excuses. He\u2019s gazed at Karuizawa-san with lewd looks before,\nhasn\u2019t he?\u201d\nI heard a doubtful voice from the girls\u2019 side. I couldn\u2019t recall having\nlooked at Karuizawa in a lewd manner before, but right now there wasn\u2019t\nanything I could do to conveniently modify my memory.\n\u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t think that A-Ayanokouji-kun would do such a thing\u2026\u201d\nI\u2019d thought that all the girls doubted me and no one would back me, but\nsomeone rather unexpected spoke up for me. Sakura, cowering behind\neveryone with her back arched, fidgeted bashfully while she spoke out in my\nfavor. I couldn\u2019t have imagined a girl who disliked being noticed more than\nanything doing such a bold thing.\n\u201cHuh? What do you mean? Why would you say that?\u201d answered\nKaruizawa, seemingly upset about Sakura speaking out.\nThe sheepish, nervous Sakura was an easy target for such a popular\n", "girl. Sakura was definitely easier to confront than Horikita. In an instant,\nKaruizawa changed her target, lashing out at Sakura with her words as if\nsinking her teeth into prey.\n\u201cHuh? Why? How do you know that? How do you know Ayanokouji-\nkun isn\u2019t the culprit?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026that\u2019s because\u2026he isn\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d Sakura was\nbacked into a corner, and barely managed to squeak out her fearful answer.\n\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t understand what you mean. That\u2019s not an answer.\u201d\nKaruizawa folded her arms and laughed mockingly at Sakura. \u201cOh? Could it\nbe that Sakura-san likes someone plain and invisible like Ayanokouji-kun?\u201d\nRather than saying it contemptuously, Karuizawa said it as though it\nwere reasonable to assume. It would\u2019ve been fine if Sakura had just shrugged\noff such remarks, but she took them on.\n\u201cY-you\u2019re wrong!\u201d Sakura stumbled back in a panic, her face\ncompletely red.\n\u201cWhoa! That\u2019s such an obvious reaction. It\u2019s like what an elementary-\nschooler would do!\u201d\nThe other girls joined Karuizawa in laughing out loud.\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026! W-well\u2026 Ah!\u201d\n\u201cHeh, isn\u2019t that a good thing, though? You like him, and no one else\ndoes, right? Hey, will you confess to him here? I\u2019ll even help you out!\u201d\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nSakura, unable to bear this attention any longer, ran off into the forest.\nKushida chased after her, wisely judging it dangerous for someone to go into\nthe woods alone.\n\u201cWhat was that about? I was just teasing her. Jeez, that\u2019s why she can\u2019t\nmake any friends.\u201d\nHorikita, who had silently watched Karuizawa\u2019s public excoriation of\nSakura, sighed and brushed a hand through her hair, as if she\u2019d observed\nsomething completely boring.\n\u201cIs it okay for us to continue the discussion now? This farce is a waste\nof time.\u201d\n", "\u201cHey, Horikita-san. The way you talk is hurtful and annoying.\u201d\nKaruizawa, losing interest in Sakura after she\u2019d run away, made Horikita her\ntarget once again. \u201cOkay, Horikita-san. Why are you so cold to me? Did\nsomething happen?\u201d\n\u201cSomething? What \u2018something\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t Hirata-kun so cool? He\u2019s smart, too, and he\u2019s even kind to\na girl like you. Any normal girl would fall for him.\u201d\nGiggling, Karuizawa tugged on Hirata\u2019s arm and pulled him close, as if\nto boast.\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019d say that Ayanokouji-kun is\u2026 Well, as for his looks, he\u2019s\nprobably better than most other guys, but isn\u2019t he awful in every other way?\nYou\u2019re probably just jealous. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re na\u00efve, Karuizawa-san.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful to be so jealous.\u201d\nI\u2019d heard that the behavior of the collective could bring out an\nindividual person\u2019s position, personality, and psychological state. Some\nthings that couldn\u2019t be voiced in our daily lives at school had started to come\nto the surface here. This was especially true for Horikita, who was often\nalone. The other girls in our class treated her poorly, but she managed to get\nalong because, well, she just didn\u2019t care. Both parties ignored each other.\nSince everyone had to live together now, a clash of tempers was inevitable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that Ayanokouji-kun has many unlikable qualities,\u201d\nHorikita said.\nHey\u2026I thought you would\u2019ve backed me up\u2026\n\u201cBut we need to ask if Hirata-kun can trust Ayanokouji-kun. It would\nonly be awkward and uncomfortable if you endorsed someone meaningless to\nHirata-kun. The truth is, there is not one thing that I trust about him, but I\nhave no intention of inserting my own personal feelings into the matter. By\nprocess of elimination, I\u2019ve concluded that he is the most trustworthy boy in\nthe class. Or is another boy in our class preferable? If there is, I\u2019d like for you\nto tell me.\u201d\nAfter Horikita finished, Karuizawa glanced over at the boys as if to\nevaluate them, and sighed.\n", "\u201cWell, I suppose that out of all the guys here, he seems the most\nharmless. He has no presence.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t help but agree with that point. The girl\u2019s perception was too\nharsh.\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that good? I have my doubts, but if Hirata-kun is\ncomfortable with this, it\u2019ll do.\u201d\nIt seemed as though Karuizawa and the other girls had chosen me, but I\nwasn\u2019t really convinced. Of course, I didn\u2019t dare breathe a word of that.\nThere\u2019d only be another fight. Immediately after the discussion had ended,\neveryone started to disperse. Our class unity had broken down.\n\u201cI understand what everyone wants to say here, but I disagree with\nsuspecting a classmate without evidence. There shouldn\u2019t be anyone in our\nclass who\u2019d do such an awful thing,\u201d said Hirata, unable to stay silent about\nour worsening situation.\n\u201cYou\u2019re way too kind, Hirata-kun. So you\u2019re saying someone else stole\nit?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t want to doubt my classmates.\u201d\nThe guys probably felt lousy being thought of as criminals by the girls.\n\u201cHey. What if it was that girl, Ibuki?\u201d someone muttered, shooting a\nlook over at Ibuki, who sat at the far edge of the camp.\nInstantly, everyone\u2019s doubts were aimed at Ibuki. The collective had\nfound new prey.\n\u201cIbuki-chan is from Class C, right? It wouldn\u2019t be strange if she were\nworking to sabotage Class D. She could be using tricks to make us doubt\neach other.\u201d\n\u201cKnock it off, you guys. The boys are without a doubt the prime\nsuspects.\u201d\nShinohara remained highly suspicious of the boys. She kept her\ndistance, gesturing with her hands for us to leave.\n\u201cUntil the culprit is found, we definitely can\u2019t trust the boys. Right,\nKaruizawa-san?\u201d\n\u201cNaturally. One of the boys definitely did it.\u201d\n", "6.2\nI\u2019ve said it again and again, but Hirata Yousuke is a really cool guy. I\ndon\u2019t even mean his appearance, but rather, his principled actions. He took\nthe initiative to do troublesome things that ordinary people didn\u2019t want to do,\nand he conducted himself respectfully even when responding to opponents.\nHirata, in cooperation with the girls, was setting up their two tents further\naway from the guys. Meanwhile, I was tasked with carrying the stakes for the\ntent, driving them into the ground, and fixing them in place.\nAlthough I had a hard time at first, what with the stakes slipping loose,\nI\u2019d soon managed to secure the first tent. It was surprisingly easy. Currently,\nI was sweaty and pounding in the stakes for the second tent with a hammer.\nHirata came around and helped by stretching the rope out and giving me a\nhand driving in the stakes.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve put you in a tough spot again.\u201d\nThe other guys were outside, either playing around or fishing.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to apologize, Hirata. If anything, I\u2019d\nfeel bad to leave it all to you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s not all bad. I do it freely.\u201d His sincere smile only enhanced his\ncoolness.\n\u201cThis question might come off as weird, but why do you work so\nhard?\u201d\n\u201cWork so hard? I don\u2019t intend to work all that hard. I just do what\nneeds to be done.\u201d Hirata said that in a way that wasn\u2019t boastful. He was\ndripping with sweat, and wiped himself off with the towel he had hanging\naround his neck. \u201cI think this special test isn\u2019t actually some kind of battle,\nbut more an important opportunity for us all to become closer. That\u2019s why I\nwant to cherish this moment. I\u2019m glad to work hard for that.\u201d\nI wondered how it was possible for an ordinary person to be so\noverflowing with good intentions without actually being two-faced. Wanting\nto be liked by others, wanting to be showered with attention\u2014most people\nwould think like that, but I didn\u2019t get that impression from Hirata at all. I felt\nthat he just wanted to be good.\n", "\u201cAll right, we have about half left. Let\u2019s hurry up and get this done.\u201d\nThe two of us went over to the other side to hammer in the remaining\nstakes.\n\u201cHirata-kun! Come here for a minute!\u201d\nKaruizawa and the other girls called Hirata\u2019s name. In an instant they\u2019d\nsurrounded him, and began tugging on his arms.\n\u201cHey, come on, come here!\u201d\n\u201cAh, I still have work left to do, though,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay to just leave that to Ayanokouji-kun? Can\u2019t you?\u201d they\nsaid, yanking him forcefully.\nSeeing Hirata\u2019s troubled face, I let him go, even though I thought it\u2019d\nbe a bother.\n\u201cI can do this. Go.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but it\u2019s hard for one person to\u00be\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, there\u2019s only a little left.\u201d\n\u201cS-sorry. Thank you. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nAlthough I kind of got the impression the girls had an ulterior motive,\nthey went ahead and pulled Hirata into the woods so fast he didn\u2019t catch my\nwords. He probably wouldn\u2019t be back right away. I watched Hirata walk off,\nthen took the hammer in hand and hoped I\u2019d get another chance to plumb his\nmany mysteries. I continued my work, and managed to finish it all myself\nbefore Hirata returned.\n\u201cIt took more time to finish it alone than I thought it would\u2026\u201d\nThere were a lot of things that concerned me, like the tent\u2019s orientation,\nthe stake placement, and the tension of the rope. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock.\nWhat should I do now? I couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake now that the\nsituation was getting dicey. But first, I needed to refresh my physical\nstrength. Working under the blazing sun was way too harsh.\n\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d Ibuki asked.\nI\u2019d thought I\u2019d rest for a while, but I guess that wasn\u2019t to be.\n\u201cWhat you were talking about this morning sounded really serious. The\n", "underwear incident, I mean. I mean, Class D isn\u2019t a monolith.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess. Our various troubles are never-ending.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever the reason, stealing a girl\u2019s underwear is unforgivable.\u201d\nRight, but why was she talking to me about this? Yamauchi had taken\nIbuki in, not me, and Kushida\u2019s group was looking after her. We\u2019d only\nspoken a little before, so there shouldn\u2019t have been any particular reason for\nher to talk to me.\n\u201cDo you doubt me, by any chance?\u201d\nIbuki had apparently seen Shinohara and the others treat me like a\ncriminal this morning.\n\u201cAre you the culprit?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s good. Well, it\u2019s not like I had any evidence or anything.\nIt looks like some of the girls trust you and that boy Hirata. I think the chance\nof you being a villain is low.\u201d\nShe\u2019d probably come to that conclusion after hearing the exchange\nbetween Karuizawa and Horikita.\n\u201cDo you have any idea who the culprit is?\u201d\n\u201cRight now, no. I really don\u2019t want to doubt the other guys.\u201d\n\u201cSo who do you think did it?\u201d\nShe\u2019d asked that question as if she were testing me. Ibuki glanced at\nme out of the corner of her eye when she said that. When I didn\u2019t respond,\nIbuki continued talking.\n\u201cIf a boy isn\u2019t the culprit, then they\u2019ll suspect me\u2014the stranger\u2014next.\nI\u2019m absolutely certain some people have already said something about me.\nAfter all, I could\u2019ve just made it look like the guys stole the underwear.\nRight?\u201d\nIbuki laughed self-deprecatingly, perhaps because she was fully aware\nshe was already a suspect. In response to that, I spoke impulsively.\n\u201cI think I trust you, at the very least. I doubt you\u2019re the culprit.\u201d\nI\u2019d answered Ibuki without hesitation. She looked a bit surprised, like\n", "she wanted to verify what I said was true. When our eyes met, she looked\naway.\n\u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t think you would say something like that.\u201d\n\u201cI just gave you an honest answer.\u201d\nI was able to understand Ibuki just by looking into her eyes.\nI concluded that Ibuki had stolen the underwear from Karuizawa\u2019s bag\nand hidden it in Ike\u2019s luggage.\n", "6.3\nIt was the end of the special test\u2019s fifth day, and Class D was\ndepressed. It was like we were holding an all-night vigil over a dead body. A\nwhole day had passed with everyone jumping at shadows. Everyone was\nsuspicious, and no one knew who the culprit was. Despite the oppressive\natmosphere, it was my turn to get the fire going. As I watched the fire\u2019s\ncondition, I occasionally tossed in some branches. It was monotonous, easy\nwork. We had other problems, though.\n\u201cHey, Ayanokouji-kun! Didn\u2019t we tell you to move the tent properly?\u201d\n\u201cI moved it like I was told.\u201d\n\u201cIt needs to be more to the left. Otherwise we\u2019re too near the guys.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nThe girls made unreasonable requests of me, and I had to reluctantly\naccept. The girls seemed resentful.\n\u201cIt must be really tough, being forced to do routine chores,\u201d Horikita\nsaid.\n\u201cThat\u2019s rich, coming from you. This wouldn\u2019t have happened if you\nhadn\u2019t had recommended me unnecessarily.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no other way. Hirata-kun can\u2019t be trusted, and I needed\ninsurance.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one in class who doesn\u2019t trust Hirata. Life\u2019s better\nwhen you stop believing that all people are two-faced.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. I\u2019m certainly not two-faced.\u201d\nThat was an understatement. Horikita lived her life completely true to\nherself. She threw my criticism back at me rather skillfully.\n\u201cHowever, most create a distinction between their public persona and\nhow they really are on the inside. You do it, too. I do not trust anyone\nbecause good intentions and hypocrisy are two sides of the same coin.\u201d\nI doubted her words were solely aimed at Hirata. She seemed to refer to\nKushida as well.\n", "\u201cAt any rate, you seem to trust Hirata-kun very much,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYeah. Well, I can count on him, at the very least. He\u2019s really reliable.\u201d\n\u201cCount on him? Can you say that he\u2019s had a positive effect on the class\njust by being around?\u201d\nHorikita must have had something on her mind, judging by her\nsnappish words. She probably thought I was holding onto information she\ndidn\u2019t have. I answered her with an audacious smile.\n\u201cWell. Hirata is a man of many talents. He helps when we can\u2019t bring\nguys and girls together during a dispute. Don\u2019t you think that he\u2019s working\nhard to bring students together when no one else can?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly impressive that he\u2019s able to take on such a role without\nbeing sullen about it. However, without good results, the action is\nmeaningless. Depending on the situation, such actions might even lead to the\nworst-case scenario. Let me ask you something. Do you know how many\npoints Class D has now?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it seems like there were some unexpected expenditures. I can\u2019t\ngive an exact number.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Trustworthy Hirata-kun has kept his mouth shut about it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d\nI wondered what in the world she wanted to show me so badly that\nshe\u2019d leave the fire unattended. As I wondered where she was taking me, I\nnoticed we were at the front entrance of the girls\u2019 tent. Horikita opened the\nmain panel and shoved me inside.\n\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nUnlike the boys\u2019 tent, which was Spartan-like in its lack of comfort, the\ngirls\u2019 tent was completely different. It was spacious, with a floor mat on the\nground so that they wouldn\u2019t have to sleep on the hard earth. There were\nseveral pillows inflated with air. On top of that was a battery-powered\ncordless fan.\n\u201cThe tent on the other side has the exact same things in it, too. A total\nof twelve points.\u201d\n", "\u201cI thought  the girls were putting up with the heat unusually well. So\nthis is how you\u2019re getting through it.\u201d\nThey hadn\u2019t sacrificed anything from the very start. They\u2019d simply\nbought whatever they needed.\n\u201cKaruizawa-san and the others asked for these.\u201d\nApparently, they\u2019d secretly indulged themselves quite well.\n\u201cI only found out after they\u2019d already ordered everything. It\u2019s difficult\nto do anything when the rules say anyone may buy an item and spend points.\u201d\nJust like how Kouenji had withdrawn so early in the test.\n\u201cKaruizawa-san reported this to Hirata-kun, so he definitely knew\nabout it. But you didn\u2019t know, nor did he inform anyone else. I think he\nabsolutely should have shared this information.\u201d\nHorikita had her arms crossed. She did have a point, but I doubted\nHirata had stayed quiet out of malice. Maybe he\u2019d just wanted to avoid\nunnecessary confusion? If Karuizawa had reported properly to Hirata, then\nthe amount could have been evaluated.\n\u201cI understand what you mean, but there\u2019s nothing I can really say about\nit. We can\u2019t get spent points back, and there aren\u2019t many days left before the\ntest ends. Karuizawa and the others probably won\u2019t spend any more points,\u201d I\nsaid.\nI\u2019d thought she\u2019d be angered by such a short, blunt response, but\nHorikita seemed to have anticipated my words. She promptly ignored me and\nkept talking.\n\u201cIf things stay as they are and nothing happens, people will probably\nstay quiet. But things could get bad if the case of the stolen underwear isn\u2019t\nresolved. If the culprit is nearby, he or she might be trying to hinder us.\nThat\u2019s why I want to find the culprit as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you want me to work with you?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Now that there\u2019s a divide between us and the boys, there are\nmany things I can\u2019t do by myself.\u201d\nThe guys and girls were in the midst of a cold war, cut off from\nobtaining new information.\n", "\u201cUnderstood. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be useful, but I\u2019ll help.\u201d\nHorikita seemed confused by my frank answer.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand you\u2026 Do you have some other intention?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better for you to just accept favors in a straightforward way. As a\nguy, I\u2019m rather upset that the guys are being treated like thieves. That alone\nshould be sufficient motivation. We\u2019re united in a common goal.\u201d\nEarlier, Hirata had asked me to help him, too.\n\u201cWell, whatever. It\u2019s settled then.\u201d\nThe culprit wasn\u2019t stupid. It wasn\u2019t likely they would show their true\ncolors while suspicions ran high. Horikita probably thought that things would\nturn out all right. Any more disturbances during this test would probably start\naffecting our points as well.\nAbout the culprit, though\u2026 Well, Ibuki would most likely take action\nagain. No, she would definitely take action. She hadn\u2019t yet reached her goal.\n\u201cYou have such a serious look on your face. Do you really hate being\ntreated like a criminal that much?\u201d\n\u201cOur class is all messed up because of this. It\u2019s a shame, because we\nwere doing really well.\u201d\n\u201cOur cooperation was a complete coincidence. Class D didn\u2019t really\nhave any sense of teamwork to begin with. It\u2019s ending rather badly, though,\nespecially because of the broken trust between the guys and girls. Of course it\nwould\u2019ve been better to stay united until the end of the test.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what the culprit\u2019s goal is, whoever that may be. Did they\nintend to steal Karuizawa\u2019s underwear, or did they want to throw our\nteamwork out the window? I feel like there\u2019s a hidden agenda.\u201d\nWhen I said the words \u201chidden agenda,\u201d Horikita crossed her arms.\nAfter considering it, she shook her head.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves\u2026 Sorry, but I\u2019m going back into the\ntent.\u201d Horikita turned away, sweeping her hair aside. Her breathing was\nshallow.\n\u201cHey Horikita, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you confessed?\u201d\n\u201cConfessed? Confessed what?\u201d\n", "Although Horikita pretended to be calm, she was sweaty. Enough was\nenough.\n\u201cYour health has gone rapidly downhill since the test started.\u201d\nShe\u2019d looked ill even before we started traveling, but it hadn\u2019t been\nthat noticeable. Due to Horikita\u2019s loner personality, she\u2019d likely planned keep\nto her room and avoid socializing.\n\u201cNot really any more than usual.\u201d\n\u201cLiar.\u201d\nI\u2019d caught Horikita in a lie, and extended my hand to touch her. Feeling\nher forehead, it was clear she had a fever. Horikita tried to escape, but her\nmovements were dull. I was easily able to stop her.\n\u201cWhen\u2026did you notice?\u201d\n\u201cOn the deck of the ship, when I asked you what you\u2019d been doing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and I told you I\u2019d been reading in my room.\u201d\n\u201cYou were really sick then, so you were actually sleeping, right?\u201d\n\u201cAnd on what evidence do you base that conclusion?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you joined us on deck, your bangs were all disheveled. Proof\nyou\u2019d been lying on your side. Also, it was incredibly hot on the boat, but\nyou seemed like you were cold. Even now, you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, and\nyou\u2019re zipped all the way up. Even an elementary school student could figure\nit out\u201d\nHorikita, who usually would have responded with strong words,\ninstead fell silent.\n\u201cIf you could apply that sharp wit toward reaching Class A, you\u2019d get a\nlittle more recognition.\u201d\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t plan to do that. Anyway, do you intend to hide your\ncondition?\u201d\nIt was pretty clear that she had a fever, close to 38\u00b0C. Still, she was\nhiding it for a pretty simple reason. If you reported illness, the class would be\nhit with a bigger penalty. The test\u2019s timing was rotten luck on her part.\n\u201cI just need to hang in there for another few days. If I give up now, it\u2019ll\n", "6.4\nI felt something strange on my cheek, warm and stiff. The warmth\ninstantly grossed me out. I tried to get stretch my neck and move my face\naway, but I couldn\u2019t move. Someone\u2019s arm was holding me tightly in place.\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d\nI woke up uncomfortable. Instantly, I found myself in a terrifying\nsituation. Sudou was asleep, with both of his legs laid across my face.\n\u201cSuzune\u2026I can\u2019t hold back anymore\u2026\u201d he moaned.\n\u201cAahhhh!\u201d\nI shrieked, and escaped from Sudou\u2019s iron grip.\n\u201cGah, shut up\u2026 The hell? Ayanokouji, don\u2019t wake me up like that.\u201d\nThis guy had just tried to force a scarring experience upon me. He had\ndefinitely mistaken me for someone else. Still, this wasn\u2019t the type of thing to\nscream about in a crowd of guys in the middle of the night\u2026\nMy wristwatch showed that it wasn\u2019t even six in the morning yet, but\nmy drowsiness was gone. I exited the tent to get out of that humid, steamy\nair. Once outside, I noticed that the scenery had changed drastically from\nyesterday.\n\u201cSo, am I lucky or unlucky?\u201d\nTrouble seemed to be at hand as the curtain rose on the sixth day of our\nspecial test. It was overcast outside, the skies cloudy and gray. It must have\nrained last night, because puddles and patches of mud were here and there on\nthe ground. It looked like it was going to start raining hard, probably in the\nearly afternoon.\nOf course the weather got stormy right at the end of the test. Just a light\nrain would have been fine, but there might be heavy rain and strong winds. In\nthe worst-case scenario, we\u2019d have to move. Many things would need to be\ndone, like re-checking the tent stakes and handling our luggage.\nAs more people noticed the weather, they began to panic. Eventually,\nwe combined the food we\u2019d collected with the emergency food we bought\n", "using points. There\u2019d been a lot of grumbling over living such a frugal life,\nbut since it was the penultimate day, everyone appeared to want to power\nthrough.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad. We haven\u2019t had any incidents,\u201d Hirata said.\nThat was certainly true. If we\u2019d had another incident like the underwear\ntheft, we probably wouldn\u2019t have had such a helpful atmosphere. The guys\nwho\u2019d been standing watch out in front of the boys\u2019 tent were now sleeping\nlike logs. It was a deterrent we came up with to prevent a repeat of the\nunderwear theft. Hirata gathered up a large group of students and gave them a\nlast bit of encouragement.\nHe also started sorting people into teams to go out and search for food\none last time, so we could get through the day. If we got enough food today\nday, we wouldn\u2019t need to use points. You could call this a critical moment.\nWe all gathered around Hirata.\n\u201cWould it be better if we went, too?\u201d asked Ike, sitting on the riverbank\nwith a fishing rod already in hand.\n\u201cNo. Ike-kun, Sudou-kun, I want you two to continue fishing. We don\u2019t\nhave enough time to instruct the other students how to do it.\u201d\nAfter settling on a course of action, Hirata set up groups by having\nvolunteers raise their hands. Of course, I didn\u2019t raise my hand, but he decided\nthat I would participate as a backup. The members of the group were\nHorikita, Sakura, Yamauchi, and surprisingly, Kushida. Horikita\u2019s physical\nhealth still seemed to be as poor as ever, but she held up well. The people\naround her weren\u2019t aware that she was feeling ill.\n\u201cWhy were you left behind? What about your usual group of friends?\u201d\nHorikita asked Kushida.\nCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t see any of Kushida\u2019s girlfriends.\n\u201cAh, yeah. Well, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nKushida whispered something into Horikita\u2019s ear, as if she was worried\nabout the boys overhearing.\n\u201cWell, to tell you the truth, Mii-chan is having her time of the month.\nShe always feels awful when it happens. So her other friends are with her in\nthe tent.\u201d\n", "I\u2019d been standing next to Horikita, so I happened to overhear.\n\u201cEven if she\u2019s not feeling well, it\u2019s a natural physiological\nphenomenon. She should be fine. I suppose that\u2019s to be expected, though.\nHowever, why did you deliberately choose our group? You must have had\nother options available.\u201d\nHorikita was grilling Kushida like that because she detested her.\nHorikita fundamentally disliked people in general, but especially Kushida.\nWhy? Well, for the simple reason that Kushida apparently hated Horikita. I\u2019d\nalways felt a uniquely strange sense of discomfort between those two.\nKushida Kikyou had a hidden side, a dramatic change from her usual\npersona, to the point where she could calmly abuse other people. However,\nI\u2019d only chanced upon this discovery. The everyday Kushida was a\nfundamentally kind, cheerful, and cute girl who loved to help others. You\nwouldn\u2019t think there\u2019d be any students who disliked her, unless they were\njealous. However, I knew Horikita wasn\u2019t the sort to be jealous of someone\nlike Kushida.\nPhilosophers wrack their brains over the tough questions like, \u201cWhat\ncame first, the chicken or the egg?\u201d The chicken is literally born from the\negg, but doesn\u2019t that mean the egg came first? I didn\u2019t know whether it was\nHorikita who hated Kushida first, or the other way around, or when this all\nstarted.\n\u201cI wanted to talk to you, Horikita-san, and thought this was a good\nchance. You know, we haven\u2019t really talked at all during this trip, have we?\nWell, as soon as it gets dark out, let\u2019s head to bed.\u201d\nEven though Kushida understood that she was disliked, and disliked\nHorikita in turn, she wanted to try making friends with her. If Kushida\u2019s goal\nwas to make friends with everyone in class, she couldn\u2019t avoid dealing with\nHorikita.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have enough free time to spend it with you unnecessarily.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so mean, Horikita-san. Even though your face is so cute when\nyou\u2019re sleeping.\u201d\nHorikita seemed a little annoyed by Kushida\u2019s odd teasing. At any rate,\nI was going to search for food with the rest of the group.\n", "\u201cHey, Ibuki. Why don\u2019t you come with us, too?\u201d Just as we were about\nto depart, I called out to Ibuki, who was resting under a tree.\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s the last day. If you don\u2019t want to, I won\u2019t pressure you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I owe Class D a debt of gratitude\u2026 Sure, I\u2019ll help.\u201d\nIbuki slung her bag over her shoulder. Yamauchi looked happy about\nthis.\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s great! You know, this kinda feels like a harem\nor something!\u201d he cried.\nThe greater the girl to boy ratio, the happier Yamauchi was. Horikita\ndidn\u2019t have any reason to refuse, so she stepped into the forest without a\nresponse.\n\u201cThe forest is kinda eerie\u2026 Or maybe I should say that it\u2019s scary, plus\nhot and humid.\u201d\nThe sky was cloudy, and the forest was completely different from\nyesterday. Visibility was especially poor. Yamauchi, with great sweat stains\nunder his armpits, dejectedly flapped his gym clothes to fan himself.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you hot, Sakura?\u201d he asked.\nYamauchi had been scheming for a way to talk to Sakura. But his eyes\nwere focused on her breasts, and it was easy to see that he simply wanted to\nlook at her boobs.\n\u201cEh? O-oh, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nSakura leaned forward, as if to indirectly avoid Yamauchi\u2019s gaze. It\u2019s\nsaid that girls are sensitive to the lascivious male gaze. In Sakura\u2019s case,\nshe\u2019d had a lot of experience in that regard, so she was especially sensitive to\nit.\n\u201cKaruizawa was so mean yesterday, wasn\u2019t she? And even though you\nwere being so kind by sticking up for Ayanokouji, Sakura.\u201d\n\u201cAh, oh\u2026\u201d\nYamauchi intended to appear kind when speaking to Sakura, but his\ngaze and topic of conversation had the subtlety of an exploding bomb.\n", "\u201cYamauchi. It\u2019d be good if you paid attention to the treetops. They\nmight have fruit. Also, we\u2019re pretty tall, so we need to be careful around\nhere,\u201d I said.\n\u201cY-yeah. Of course.\u201d\nThus I prevented Yamauchi from gazing lustfully at Sakura, at least\nsomewhat. Still, a supremely horny guy wasn\u2019t going to run out of steam.\n\u201cRain clouds are approaching from the southwest. The storm will be\nhere even sooner than we imagined.\u201d\nDepending on how things went, it would be better to get out of the rain\nif at all possible. Rain would make our foraging mission more dangerous. If\nwe did happen to get caught in the rain out in the middle of the forest, we\ncould be stuck or injured. If that happened, we\u2019d lose a great deal of points.\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\nWe looked for food while walking quietly. Kushida alternated between\nlooking at Horikita and me, while appearing lost in thought. Of course,\nHorikita ignored everything.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Kushida-chan?\u201d asked Yamauchi, who\u2019d noticed\nKushida\u2019s odd behavior.\n\u201cAyanokouji-kun and Horikita-san have been on pretty good terms\nfrom the beginning, right? I was trying to think of what the reason might be.\u201d\n\u201cGood question. Why are you two close, anyway?\u201d\nKushida had opened a troublesome subject.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really get along well, though,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou always deny it, but you do get along. You\u2019re walking side by side\nright now.\u201d\nThey could say it, but it wasn\u2019t like I was particularly aware of it or\nanything.\n\u201cAh. I think I might have found something that Ayanokouji-kun and\nHorikita-san have in common,\u201d Kushida said.\n\u201cSomething in common? What\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cWell, look at them closely, Yamauchi-kun. Notice anything?\u201d\n", "\u201cHmm?\u201d\nYamauchi got in really close, until he was about a centimeter away\nfrom my face. After that, he rushed over to Horikita, and peered into her\neyes. You idiot, if you get too close\u2026\nSlap! Yamauchi\u2019s cheek got smacked. It was a wonderfully vicious\nslap, the kind you\u2019d see from a humiliated actress in a searing drama. After\nbeing hit with such force, Yamauchi shuddered and shouted. He squatted\nlow, cowering, and cried in pain. He didn\u2019t use any words, but his eyes\nseemed to ask Horikita, \u201cWhy would you do something like that?!\u201d\n\u201cWh-what\u2019re yuh doin\u2019?!\u201d\n\u201cYou got too close. Remember to stay out of my personal space.\u201d\nThis was like the time Ike made a pass at Horikita. Really, anyone\nwould feel uncomfortable if a guy you didn\u2019t like got extremely close to your\nface.\n\u201cHa ha\u2026 S-sorry, Yamauchi-kun. I started trouble. Are you okay?\u201d\nKushida asked.\n\u201cY-you\u2019re so kind, Kushida\u2026\u201d\nYamauchi took Kushida\u2019s outstretched hand and stood, his cheeks still\nred. Ibuki watched the scene with a slightly surprised expression. She\nprobably didn\u2019t see this kind of idiotic exchange in Class C very often.\n\u201cWh-what\u2019s the thing in common that you noticed, Kushida?\u201d\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t you know? I hardly see the two of them laugh! That\u2019s it.\nIt\u2019s like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Ayanokouji-kun or Horikita-san smile.\u201d\nKushida had pointed out something rather unexpected, thinking that\nwe\u2019d merely accept her word. Regarding Horikita, though, I\u2019d seen her smile\nmany times before when making fun of someone, but her smile never\ncontained any kind of affection.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that I\u2019ve never seen Horikita smile before. But I\u2019ve\nsmiled, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you with a bitter smile, sure, but never a genuine grin,\nsomething from the bottom of your heart. I\u2019ve never seen you laugh so hard\nyou had to clutch your stomach, Ayanokouji-kun. Or perhaps you\u2019ve just\n", "never shown that side of yourself to me?\u201d\nShe looked slightly dissatisfied as she peeked up at me. My heart\nstarted pounding. My pulse spiked. Even though we were on a deserted\nisland, a lovely, perfumed scent tickled my nostrils. Embarrassed, I averted\nmy eyes.\n\u201cA lot of it\u2019s due to genetics. It\u2019s the difference between people who\nsmile often and those who don\u2019t smile at all.\u201d\n\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think I really like that reason, even if it\u2019s true.\u201d\nWell, genetics probably weren\u2019t everything. Happiness could also be\ninfluenced by the environment in which someone grew up.\n\u201cHow about we practice smiling just once? What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cFor the time being, let\u2019s begin with the area,\u201d said Horikita.\n\u201cHuh? Of smiling?\u201d\n\u201cHow long do you want to travel? We need to search for food, right?\u201d\nsaid Horikita sternly. Her tone was forceful. She\u2019d instructed us all to spread\nout immediately.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make any moves alone. Search in pairs. Be especially careful.\nLet\u2019s go, Ayanokouji-kun.\u201d\nHorikita called me, and I started walking with her.\n\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Sakura seemed to be trailing behind us with her shoulders\nslumped.\n\u201cCome search with us, Sakura!\u201d Yamauchi yelled.\nHe flashed me a thumbs-up gesture. I guessed he dreamed of taking\nadvantage of this opportunity.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with you, Ibuki-san!\u201d\nKushida, the last one remaining, paired up with Ibuki. Ibuki was a\nrather blunt, antisocial girl herself, but if she were with Kushida, there likely\nwouldn\u2019t be problems.\n\u201cHorikita, how are you going to handle the key card issue?\u201d I asked.\n", "\u201cI always have it on me.\u201d\nHorikita put her hand in her coat pocket to show me she had it.\n\u201cWhen we update the device, I\u2019ll slip in among the students Hirata-\nkun\u2019s gathered so I can be undetected. Ibuki-san and the other students aren\u2019t\nsupposed to know.\u201d\nWell, I wasn\u2019t really worried about her handling that part. Since it\nrequired being conscientious, she\u2019d probably handle it well.\n\u201cCan I see it for a second?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually convenient to do it here. It\u2019d be too suspicious at base\ncamp.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but what do you plan to do after I show you?\u201d\nI explained the situation to Horikita while she looked suspiciously at\nme.\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d been keeping quiet. I was with Sakura earlier so she\ncan back me up, but on the first day we saw students who had something like\na key card.\u201d\nI told Horikita about seeing Katsuragi in front of the cave, and his card.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that was really the key card. I didn\u2019t see it well. I\nmean, you\u2019d probably laugh if I made a joke about him picking up a\ntelephone card, right?\u201d\n\u201cEr, right. If you have proof, that would be a huge achievement.\u201d\nHorikita, satisfied with my reasoning, turned her back on Ibuki and\nstealthily took out the card. I accepted it, and checked the front and back. The\nreverse side sported a typical magnetic strip. Just as Chabashira-sensei had\nsaid, on the front side was the name \u201cHorikita Suzune\u201d, proof that she was\nthe leader.\nEven if I tried, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to peel the name off and\nsubstitute another.\n\u201cWell? Is this the same card that Katsuragi-kun had?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I wonder, though. I thought I\u2019d know by looking, but\u2026it seems\n", "like it\u2019s a different color than I remember.\u201d\n\u201cThe keycards might have a different color scheme based on the class.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but we don\u2019t have enough evidence to make a solid judgment.\nIf we make a mistake, we won\u2019t recover from it.\u201d\nWhen I tried to return the card to her, I accidentally dropped it. The\ncard hit the ground.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nI let out a panicked shout, but Horikita quickly snatched it up. She slid\nthe card back in her jacket, but we\u2019d attracted attention.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nKushida looked worried. Ibuki, too.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. There was a bug that surprised me. Sorry, sorry.\u201d\nWhile I apologized, Horikita shot me a terrifying glare.\n\u201cS-sorry\u2026\u201d\nHorikita furiously kept her distance from me.\n\u201cDid she dump you?\u201d Yamauchi asked with a grin.\n\u201cLook, Yamauchi. I need to ask you something. Could you come here\nfor a second?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it? You know my love consultation fee is high, right?\u201d\n\u201cThe ground in this area is all muddy because of the rain, right? I want\nyou to take this mud and smear it on Horikita\u2019s hair. Can you do that for\nme?\u201d\n\u201cHuh? B-but if I do something like that, I\u2019ll be killed! No way!\u201d\nOf course, I knew he wouldn\u2019t immediately agree. But this was far too\nunnatural for me to do myself. I\u2019d thought that a prankster like Yamauchi\nwould try pulling this stunt.\n\u201cListen here, dude. No matter how angry you say you are at Horikita,\ntrying to get revenge on her is uncool!\u201d\n\u201cIf you do this, I\u2019m prepared to offer you Sakura\u2019s e-mail address.\u201d\n\u201cWhaa?!\u201d\n", "\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cS-Sakura\u2019s e-mail address? Man! I-I guess I have to do this now,\nhuh?\u201d\nThe boy who lived for love had decided to die for love. That\ndecisiveness was amazing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely going to do it? If you\u2019re lying, I won\u2019t agree.\u201d\nAfter I nodded, Yamauchi gathered up a lot of mud and approached\nHorikita from behind. Had she not been feeling ill, she probably would\u2019ve\nnoticed him, but right now she couldn\u2019t pay attention to her surroundings.\nKushida and Ibuki noticed Yamauchi\u2019s strange behavior and watched him\nwith quizzical expressions.\nYamauchi did it. He covered Horikita\u2019s beautiful black hair with mud.\nThen he patted and smeared it on her with both hands. Well, he didn\u2019t really\nneed to go that far\u2026\n\u201cHa ha ha ha! You\u2019re all covered in mud, Horikita! Hilarious!\u201d\nYamauchi laughed and pointed at Horikita, like a little kid. Horikita,\nalmost as if she weren\u2019t able to grasp the situation, didn\u2019t move for a little\nwhile. Then she stood up, grabbed Yamauchi\u2019s pointing arm, and acted\nwithout saying a word.\nYamauchi let slip a quick, confused \u201cHuh?\u201d as Horikita threw him.\n", "6.5\nWe returned to the base camp before noon with nothing to show for\nour efforts. Although the sun hadn\u2019t come out, it was even hotter here than\ninside the midsummer forest. It was impossible not to see a thin layer of\nsweat even on Horikita, who insisted that she wasn\u2019t sweaty.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better wash up right away, Horikita-san. You\u2019re really\nmuddy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 This situation is rather painful.\u201d\nHorikita, her hair and clothes completely covered with mud, couldn\u2019t\nhelp but be uncomfortable. It would\u2019ve been uncomfortable even if she\nweren\u2019t sick.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold a grudge against you for the rest of my life. You\u2019d\nbest prepare yourself.\u201d\nYamauchi, who\u2019d been viciously beaten, cowered behind my back as\nhe trembled in fear.\n\u201cI, I, I d-did it! S-so, you have to keep your promise!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. When the test is over, I will tell you.\u201d\nI felt bad for Sakura, but I needed to reward Yamauchi for his act of\nbravery.\n\u201cOh no, looks like it\u2019s impossible to use the shower room\u2026\u201d\nThe girls who\u2019d returned from exploring were gathered in front of the\nshower, waiting in line. Unfortunately, the three people in line were\nKaruizawa and her group. If Horikita got in line now, she would have a pretty\nlong time to wait. Due to being covered in mud, she didn\u2019t want to yield. But\ngetting in line behind a hostile Karuizawa make it difficult to cut in.\n\u201cWhat about the river? That\u2019d be easy and fast, right?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cRight. Looks like I don\u2019t have any other choice.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go for a swim. Ibuki-san, do you want to go for a\nswim with me? I got pretty sweaty. If we get permission, is it okay for\nsomeone from Class C to use the river?\u201d\n", "Using the spot without permission wasn\u2019t allowed, but there shouldn\u2019t\nbe any problems.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass. I don\u2019t really like swimming, so I\u2019ll just wait to use the\nshower room,\u201d Ibuki said.\n\u201cW-well, I will, too\u2026\u201d\nSakura, following Ibuki\u2019s lead, refused to go swimming. Probably she\ndidn\u2019t want the boys to see her in her swimsuit. Undoubtedly, taking a\nshower with warm water was best, but since it was quite cloudy outside, it\nwas also fairly hot and humid. Horikita probably wasn\u2019t confident that she\ncould continue waiting in her poor health. Yamauchi, who\u2019d been beaten\nblack and blue, headed with me toward the tent.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to rest for a bit. The parts where I got punched really\nhurt\u2026\u201d\nYamauchi wept a bit as he hobbled inside. Although he\u2019d been a\nsuitable person for the job, it was a horrible task. As for Horikita, I couldn\u2019t\nsee her, so I guessed that she\u2019d already started changing into her swimsuit.\nMeanwhile, the number of people waiting to use the shower had gradually\nincreased. Behind Karuizawa\u2019s group was Sakura, and behind her was Ibuki.\nThen another girl lined up behind them.\nQuite a few students were swimming in the river, and it looked as\nthough they were having fun. A few minutes later, Horikita and Kushida\nappeared in their swimsuits. I went to the boys\u2019 luggage pile, then wandered\naround looking for privacy. When I returned about five minutes later, I saw\nHorikita washing herself while standing in the river. The cold river water\nmust have felt horrible on Horikita\u2019s sick body, but she must have been\nhappy the mud was gone.\n\u201cWhoa, looks like it\u2019s moving now.\u201d\nI nodded at Ibuki, who was waiting at the tail end of the shower line.\n", "6.6\nI\u2019d been waiting for about fifteen minutes in front of the boys\u2019 tent\nbefore Horikita appeared. She kept her eyes downcast, as if something was\nwrong. Then she slowly looked up and scanned the area. When her eyes met\nmine, her pupils trembled, like she was frightened. She approached me with\nheavy, plodding steps. Despite her seeming frailty, I couldn\u2019t think of her as\nsimply weak.\n\u201cAyanokouji-kun. Could you please come here for a moment?\u201d\nFirst, I turned around and checked to see if Ibuki was still lined up for\nthe shower.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d I asked Horikita.\n\u201cFollow me. We can\u2019t talk here.\u201d\nWith that, Horikita walked toward the forest.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you planning to search for more food?\u201d\nHorikita walked without answering me. She stopped once we\u2019d gotten\nfar enough away that we couldn\u2019t see the camp anymore. Horikita turned\naround and looked ready to speak, but then hesitated as though having second\nthoughts.\n\u201cThis happened because of my carelessness. I am aware that I made a\nmistake. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cA mistake?\u201d\n\u201cIt was stolen.\u201d\n\u201cW-wait, your underwear was stolen, too?\u201d\n\u201cNo. This is much, much worse. The\u2026key card. A complete blunder\non my part.\u201d\nHorikita looked completely disgusted with herself, a look I had never\nseen her make before.\n\u201cI wanted to talk to you because I trust you. I absolutely couldn\u2019t\nconsult with someone who might be the culprit. This is so humiliating. I want\n", "to die\u2026\u201d\nI felt honored that she trusted me, but I couldn\u2019t exactly rejoice in front\nof someone so depressed.\n\u201cSuch a huge failure.\u201d\n\u201cNo, the one who stole it is to blame. Right?\u201d\n\u201cEven so, this is an issue of responsibility. It has nothing to do with me\nbeing sick or covered in mud.\u201d\nHorikita hung her head. If this got out, it could cause us massive\ndamage.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to let go of the card for a single second. But I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. I doubt this\u2019ll be any consolation, but I think\nyou did your absolute best.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know if she heard me. She merely bit her lower lip, as if\noverwhelmed with regret.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably better if we don\u2019t make this information public. We\nshould get to the truth first.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I think so, too.\u201d\nEveryone would panic if they knew. I wanted to avoid that at least.\n\u201cI suspect two people. Either Karuizawa-san, or Ibuki-san.\u201d\nThe former might have done it simply out of hatred. Karuizawa could\nhave stolen it because she wanted to see Horikita panic after losing the card.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the chances of that are low. Karuizawa was in front of\nthe shower the whole time.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Same goes for her flunkies, too.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s highly likely Ibuki-san is the culprit. It\u2019s\npossible she came to know about the card this morning, and the timing is just\nfar too good. But, wouldn\u2019t stealing it be an extremely dangerous gamble?\nSince the leader\u2019s name is engraved on the card itself, just looking at it would\nbe enough. Maybe she carried out the crime so she\u2019d get a penalty.\u201d\n", "She looked at me, her eyes full of anxiety, as if searching for an answer\nfrom me. I placed my hand on Horikita\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cIf we examine the timing and talk with Ibuki, we can understand what\nhappened. If we suspect Ibuki, we shouldn\u2019t take our eyes off of her. Her\nescape would probably be the worst-case scenario, right?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry, but can you go back to camp first? That way\nyou can start following her immediately.\u201d\n\u201cSure. I understand. I\u2019ll keep an eye on her.\u201d\nI felt like Horikita probably wanted to be alone to throw up. I left her\nand returned to the base camp.\n", "6.7\nHorikita returned about ten minutes later, rejoining the campsite\u2019s\nunsettling atmosphere. The cause was dark smoke coming from behind the\ntemporary toilet. It was far too early for the bonfire to be lit, and the location\nwas rather strange.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that smoke? What in the world happened?\u201d Ike cried.\nAs I joined up with Horikita, I also caught up with Ike, who was clearly\nin a panic. I asked what was up.\n\u201cThis is serious. There\u2019s a fire! Fire! Something is burning behind the\ntoilet!\u201d\nAll of the girls who\u2019d been lined up in front of the shower room were\ngone now. They must have left as soon as they heard the uproar.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see Ibuki. The fire might have been her handiwork. Where is\nshe?\u201d Horikita asked.\n\u201cShe noticed the fire, and now she\u2019s just walking around.\u201d\nI rushed toward the area behind the temporary toilet and saw Hirata and\nsome of the others. Ibuki was also there. Horikita looked ready to call out to\nIbuki, but hesitated when she saw her. Ibuki\u2019s expression was just so genuine.\nShe couldn\u2019t hide her confusion about the fire.\n\u201cDoes this mean she didn\u2019t do it?\u201d\nHorikita was overwhelmed by doubt. If the keycard had indeed been\nstolen, Ibuki must\u2019ve done it. If a fire had started, then Ibuki must\u2019ve caused\nit. Even so, Ibuki remained at the scene, and appeared surprised by the fire.\nWhen I examined more closely, the source looked like a bundle of paper.\nSome of it was still legible, but most of it had turned into soot. I didn\u2019t know\nwhat it was for a moment.\nHowever, looking at the legible parts, I finally understood.\n\u201cDid the manual get burned?\u201d Horikita asked.\n\u201cYeah. It looks like it. Who would do this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one thing after another\u2026\u201d Horikita muttered in a low voice,\n", "lowering her eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m responsible for this. The manual was in my bag. We piled the\nbags up in front of the tent and I didn\u2019t think that someone would steal\nanything in the daytime. But first, we need to extinguish this fire properly\u2026\u201d\nRather than searching for the culprit, Hirata headed to the river to\ndouse the fire. While he drew water in our plastic bottles, he muttered to\nhimself, his expression dark.\n\u201cWhy? Who could do something like this? Why can\u2019t we all just get\nalong?\u201d\nHirata spontaneously crushed the plastic bottle with all his might. The\nshift in his personality was rather terrifying. Hirata, the eternal leader of our\nclass, the one who toiled tirelessly to play peacemaker, was carrying a terrible\nburden.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to take so much on yourself.\u201d I tried comforting\nhim. He stood and responded with a quiet \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cWe need\u2026to discuss this incident properly.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Most of Class D witnessed the fire. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll want to\nknow the truth.\u201d\nDepressed, Hirata took the water he\u2019d scooped up and returned to the\ncampsite.\n\u201cHey, who did this? Is there a traitor in our class?\u201d Karuizawa asked.\nWhen we returned, we found her leading the confrontation between the\nguys and girls, who glared at one another.\n\u201cWhy do you suspect us? Isn\u2019t this a completely separate issue from\nthe underwear incident?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Isn\u2019t it possible you burned something to\nmislead us?\u201d\n\u201cStop jerking us around. As if we\u2019d do something like this!\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute, everyone. Please, calm down. Let\u2019s talk about this,\u201d\nHirata cried.\nHe gave me the water and I took his place, extinguishing the remnants\nof the fire. Hirata immediately went to the center of the circle and tried to\n", "play mediator. This might have been residual stress from yesterday\u2019s\nunderwear theft incident, but both sides were heated up and showed no signs\nof settling down. It seemed like quite a few people in Class D wanted to start\nhunting the culprit right here.\n\u201cAt any rate, we don\u2019t have to worry about the fire spreading.\u201d\nI shook the empty plastic bottles twice, then three times. A few water\ndroplets plopped onto the smoldering remains of the fire. I looked up.\n\u201cRain, huh?\u201d\nRaindrops dripped onto my cheeks. The clouds were even darker than\nthey\u2019d been before, proof that heavy rain was about to start. Once, we\u2019d have\nall come together as one to make it through this last pinch. Now, the guys and\ngirls were locked in a tense confrontation. They stood, glaring at each other.\n\u201cThis is pointless. Seriously, this is the worst. We have underwear\nthieves and now arsonists in our class. This really is the worst.\u201d\n\u201cWe keep telling you it wasn\u2019t us! How long are you going to keep\nsuspecting us?!\u201d\nThe fight would never be resolved. It would just keep going on forever.\nHirata should\u2019ve stepped in and stopped this, but for some reason he just\nstood there in a daze. Was he wondering who the culprit could have been?\n\u201cHey Kanji, I can\u2019t see Ibuki anywhere.\u201d\nYamauchi had noticed Ibuki was gone. I noticed that one of the bags\nwas also gone.\n\u201cPerhaps the person who started the fire\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather suspicious. If a fire broke out then, that would mean\u2026\u201d\nThe guys directed their suspicions at Ibuki, and even the girls began to\nvoice their doubts. However, before we could reach a resolution, the rain\nstarted to fall, and fall hard.\n\u201cOh no, this isn\u2019t good. Let\u2019s discuss this later. It\u2019ll be awful if we all\nget soaked.\u201d\nIke and the others, panicking, began shoving food and luggage inside\nthe tents.\n\u201cHirata, tell us what to do!\u201d\n", "Ike called for Hirata, but he just stood in the same place. Hirata\ncontinued staring off into nothingness and didn\u2019t budge an inch. Meanwhile,\nthe sound of rain kept growing louder and louder. I was a little worried about\nthe situation. I approached Hirata, but there wasn\u2019t any sign that he noticed\nme.\n\u201cWhy\u2026why is this happening? It\u2019s just like back then\u2026\u201d\nHe muttered something in a low voice. I couldn\u2019t understand what it\nmeant, but it certainly wasn\u2019t trivial. This wasn\u2019t like the calm and composed\nHirata at all.\n", "\u201cWhy was I doing this? Why was I doing all this until now?\u201d\n\u201cHey, Hirata! What are you doing?!\u201d Ike shouted.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if Hirata heard him at all. I gently placed my hand on his\nshoulder. He looked surprised, but slowly turned around.\n\u201cIke\u2019s calling for you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHirata\u2019s face was drained of life. He was pale. The second time Ike\ncalled, Hirata slowly started to regain his sanity. He finally noticed that it had\nbegun raining.\n\u201cRain\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be good for you to help Ike and the others. We have to keep our\nstuff dry.\u201d\n\u201cY-yeah. We need to take care of everything quickly.\u201d\n\u201cAyanokouji. Is Hirata okay?\u201d Sudou asked.\n\u201cLooks like he\u2019s in shock. I suppose it\u2019s probably because of all these\nthings going wrong one after the other.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, in junior high there was this rich kid honor student. He\nhad a lot of really heavy responsibilities, y\u2019know? Anyway, he took so much\non himself that one day, he ended up having a breakdown. After that, his\nclass became a complete mess.\u201d\n\u201cYou think there are signs of that with Hirata?\u201d\n\u201cWell, saying he\u2019s gonna have a breakdown would be an exaggeration,\nbut I think there\u2019s danger there.\u201d\nI wondered if this was just Sudou\u2019s wild imagination at work, but it\nseemed surprisingly accurate. Since this special test had started, Hirata has\ntaken on a lot of responsibilities. These issues made the troubles we\u2019d faced\nat school seem easy. Hirata\u2019s carefully maintained environment had definitely\nbegun to change. The theft of Karuizawa\u2019s underwear and the uproar over the\nfire had turned Hirata as unhinged and stormy as the weather.\n\u201cFor the time being, let\u2019s take care of the luggage.\u201d\nWe joined up and helped the students put things away. Thankfully,\n", "everything got secured pretty fast.\n\u201cOkay. All of the preparations are made.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t surprise me that Ibuki disappeared, but Horikita had vanished\nas well. By my calculations, the possibility had been fifty-fifty, but it seemed\nthings were progressing favorably. I fixed my eyes on the road that led\nstraight to the beach, and stepped onto the path.\n", "6.8\nI forced my heavy, sluggish body to chase after Ibuki-san while the\nhard rain fell. The sky was covered with rain clouds that blocked out the sun,\nso visibility was poor. Even though I couldn\u2019t see Ibuki-san, she\u2019d left\nfootprints in the muddy ground. If I just followed them, they\u2019d lead me right\nto her.\nShe\u2019d walked about a hundred meters from the base camp, sometimes\nveering off to the right or left. Rather unexpectedly, I found her waiting, as if\nexpecting me. I instinctively hid myself, though there probably wasn\u2019t any\npoint.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Horikita?\u201d\nIbuki spoke without even turning around. Her calm voice cut right\nthrough the sounds of the falling rain.\n\u201cI noticed you following me. Why don\u2019t you just come on out?\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you notice me?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cRight from the start.\u201d\nHer short answer felt ominous. My impression of her as being quiet\nand taciturn didn\u2019t change, but something was different.\n\u201cWhy were you following me?\u201d\n\u201cDo you really not know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nIt was almost like I was the villain here.\n\u201cYou clearly know why I was following you, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI really have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nIbuki-san faced me, looking me straight in the eye. I saw no deception\nin her eyes whatsoever. It almost made me want to apologize. After all, I had\nno proof. I only had my intuition.\n\u201cWhy should I lie?\u201d she pressed further, as if she noticed my hesitation.\n\u201cI\u2019d at least like to hear why you followed me, from your own lips.\u201d\n", "\u201cThe underwear theft and the fire. Misfortune continues to befall Class\nD.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\u201cDo you realize that some people suspect you?\u201d\n\u201cAh. I suppose since I\u2019m an outsider, there\u2019s not much I can do about\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m the culprit? Do you have any proof?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have a single shred of evidence related to the\nunderwear theft. But I think it was you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty terrible thing to say. You don\u2019t have any evidence, yet\nyou suspect me?\u201d\nI had to admit, I was impressed by how she was handling this. She\u2019d\nlaid low until day five, and she\u2019d kept her distance from Class D. Contrary to\nnormal expectations, she wasn\u2019t suspected.\n\u201cI suspect you because of today. You don\u2019t need me to explain that, do\nyou?\u201d\nI wanted to hear it from Ibuki-san herself. If I explained all of the\nreasons for my doubts, that would almost be the same as admitting my\nidentity as the leader. Even if I was 99% confident, so long as there was a 1%\nchance of her being innocent, I needed to avoid being direct.\n\u201cLet me cut to the chase. I want you to return something you took from\nme,\u201d I said to Ibuki-san, while I stood and stared her in the eye.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nAfter giving that short answer, she walked away quickly. I followed,\nmatching her speed. Ibuki-san changed course and headed toward the center\nof the forest.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d\nIt was difficult to walk straight. I\u2019d realized this over the past several\ndays. That was even truer in this weather, which impaired visibility.\n", "However, Ibuki-san didn\u2019t seem to care. I couldn\u2019t pull back, though, not\nafter coming this far to find the truth. Since I\u2019d made the mistake, I had to\ntake responsibility and solve the problem.\nI have to make up for my mistake. I have to make up for my mistake. I\nrepeated those same words over and over again in my head. I couldn\u2019t fail\nhere. Besides, I also needed to take responsibility for my mistakes with\nKaruizawa-san, with whom I had been really aggressive. My heart beat fast. I\nwas breathless. Little by little, I closed the distance between Ibuki-san and\nmyself. Depending on the situation, I might need to retrieve the keycard by\nforce. Considering my considerable skills, I could handle it well. I can handle\nit well. I can do it. I can do it.\nI understood all too well that I wasn\u2019t calm, but I had to do something.\nI didn\u2019t have anyone else to rely on. I\u2019d handled things on my own up until\nthis point, and I could continue just the same. The rain and winds were a bit\neasier to deal with in the middle of the forest than on an open road. But the\nvisibility had become that much worse, and the footing even more terrible.\nAlso, as I went right and then left, I lost my sense of direction.\nBut my biggest problem was my physical condition. With every second\nthat passed, I grew worse. Up until now I\u2019d only had a slight fever, but as the\nrain came down I reached my limits. My sickness grew steadily worse.\nIbuki-san stopped, and then unexpectedly looked up at a tree. She\ngazed at a single handkerchief, wet from the rain and tied to the tree.\n\u201cHow long are you going to follow me? Don\u2019t you think enough is\nenough?\u201d\n\u201cOnce you return what you stole from me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you calm down and try thinking? If I stole the keycard,\nwould I have held onto it? If someone saw me with it, that would mean\nimmediate disqualification. I\u2019d only end up losing points myself, right?\u201d\nI had only asked she return what she stole. I never once said anything\nabout a keycard. Ibuki-san had just confessed. As I was about to press her on\nthat point, Ibuki-san gave a thin smile that showed her white teeth.\n\u201cYou thought I confessed to something, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n", "\u201cI\u2019m tired of talking with you.\u201d\nIbuki-san crouched, and started digging in the ground using both hands.\n\u201cAh, agh\u2026\u201d\nWracked by intense dizziness and nausea, I leaned my back against a\nnearby tree.\n\u201cYour condition has gotten a lot worse, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIbuki-san turned to look at me. However, she quickly returned to work.\n\u201cAh\u2026 Ah\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d\nAlthough I was trying to manage my breathing, I couldn\u2019t anymore.\nMy jersey, soaked from the downpour, leached my body heat away. I\u2019d tried\nto resist wanting to lie down and rest, but I could no longer hold my head up.\nAs I thought about my physical strength, I had no choice but to fight.\n\u201cIbuki-san. I\u2019m going to investigate you with everything I\u2019ve got. You\ndon\u2019t mind?\u201d\nIbuki-san stopped digging, stood up, and approached me.\n\u201cWith everything you\u2019ve got? Could you be a bit more specific? You\nmean you\u2019re going to resort to violence?\u201d\n\u201cThis is your last warning. Return it\u2026\u201d\nI\u2019d wanted to avoid coercive methods, but there was no other way. I\ndidn\u2019t want to show this side of myself to anyone\u2026\nI remembered the incident before, with Sudou-kun, where he\u2019d\npunched some students from Class C. It had led to a trial, with the school\ngetting involved. Back then I\u2019d condemned Sudou, who had dealt with many\nunexpected difficulties. I\u2019d abandoned him then, and was getting my just\ndesserts now. That I would consider solving things with violence was\nridiculously funny.\n\u201cMy last warning, huh? Oh, I get it. I get it. Why don\u2019t you get your\nwish?\u201d\nShe dropped the bag to the ground and raised her arms in the air,\nposing as if surrendering. She was obedient, but I saw no resignation in her\nface. Still, I couldn\u2019t let this opportunity pass. I reached to check the bag.\n", "Instantly, Ibuki-san\u2019s slender leg went right toward my face. What little\nalertness I had left saved me. I flew backwards, avoiding her kick. Mud\nsplashed me, and I struck a defensive posture with both arms raised.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re good,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAn act of violence means immediate disqualification\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSomeone might see us here, you mean? Weren\u2019t you willing to use\nviolence, too?\u201d\nWhile I wondered why she had such a sly grin on her face, she\nsuddenly grabbed my shoulders and threw me down. I wasn\u2019t able to react in\nthe face of such an unexpected action, and collapsed onto the muddy ground.\n\u201cWould you like a moment to rest?\u201d she asked.\nAs I was on the ground, already wounded, she sneered at me from\nabove. Her face looked all blurry. Ibuki-san grabbed my collar and yanked\nme up. If she hit me, I would definitely lose consciousness. I slipped out of\nher grip and rolled, escaping from her. I desperately tried to raise myself out\nof the mud. That was the first time I was really thankful that I practiced\nmartial arts.\n\u201cOh? You can really move, surprisingly. You practice or something?\u201d\nIbuki-san, without panicking whatsoever, seemed genuinely impressed\nas she sized me up. She\u2019d perceived my knowledge of martial arts, and\nprobably wasn\u2019t an average practitioner herself. How could I respond without\ntelling her that I was in the worst condition?\n\u201cI\u2019ve\u2026been nothing but a complete and utter failure in this test.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t contributed a single thing to Class D. If anything, I was\nprobably a hindrance. The rest of them, all trying their hardest, were held\nback because of my poor physical condition. I wished I\u2019d told them from the\nstart. I could have requested that another person become the leader since I\nwasn\u2019t feeling well. It would have been fine had I just refused. But my pride\ngot the better of me, which was unforgivable.\nI mocked people. I hated useless things, labeling them incompetent,\nwhile I was useless myself. Ha ha\u2026 I laughed dryly in my mind. Was I\nreally still making excuses for myself?\n\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it? You stole the keycard.\u201d\n", "Ibuki-san stopped moving. I shortened the distance between us. She\npretended like she was going to strike with her right arm, only to instead go\nwith a high, fast kick. I avoided her attack, and then stretched out my arm as\na counterattack. Ibuki-san was aware of the danger and avoided my strike.\nShe then switched into her next attack, a dizzying back-and-forth of offense\nand defense.\nThe footing around here was bad, but she wasn\u2019t worried about her\nfootwork. Clearly she had a degree of skill. In addition, she showed no\nhesitation in hurting people. Ibuki-san smiled, flashing her white teeth as if\nshe were enjoying this. I never thought I\u2019d see such a big smile on her face.\nBecause I\u2019d been moving around so much, I was wracked by intense\ncold and nausea. I was barely able to stand.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been trying really hard until now. I\u2019ll tell you the truth, as a\nreward. I stole the card.\u201d\nIbuki-san thrust her hand into her pocket and slowly took the card out.\nShe showed me the side with my name engraved upon it.\n\u201cYou gave up the truth pretty easily.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I admit it or not now. There\u2019s no evidence I used\nviolence against you. It\u2019s not as though the school can make a judgment here.\nIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nIbuki-san had the right read of the situation. Nothing could\nconclusively make the school perceive this as it really was. Even if I was the\nonly one who got hurt, Ibuki-san could say whatever she liked to get out of it.\nEven if I complained, we\u2019d both be punished. And Class D had points to lose.\nBut if I managed to get the keycard back, we might be saved. If we got\nour hands on such reliable evidence, Class C would be forced to admit what\nthey\u2019d done.\nHer fingerprints were on the card. Maybe we could assert that it was\nlegitimately stolen. If we brought the truth to light, the school might\ninvestigate the matter thoroughly. I couldn\u2019t abandon that hope. However, I\ncouldn\u2019t get the keycard back unless I bested Ibuki-san. But I doubted she\nwas stupid enough to make bold actions.\nIf she got away, the card probably wouldn\u2019t ever be found. If that\n", "happened, we couldn\u2019t prove it had been stolen. I didn\u2019t have enough energy\nto run after her any longer. On top of that, I lacked the strength to even\nclench my fists. But I had to make use of all the strength I had left.\nI wasn\u2019t sure if Ibuki-san had a reason to hurry or if she was\nunderestimating me, but she rushed over and attacked, a hunter enjoying an\neasy kill. Her eyes glanced at my feet, but it was a fake-out. While she was\nconcentrating on the lower half of my body, she instantly swung at my face. I\nnarrowly avoided getting hit, but it got so incredibly close that it grazed my\nhair.\nI took advantage of her momentum and applied a little force. Ibuki-san\nlost her balance, but not enough to make her fall over. I tried to grab onto her\narm, but she understood what was going on and slipped through my grasp.\nShe probably realized I was trying to use her power and speed against her. I\nmustered up the last of my strength and drove my left fist into her solar\nplexus.\n\u201cAh!\u201d\nIbuki-san couldn\u2019t breathe, and fell to her knees in apparent agony. At\nthe same time, my physical strength had reached its limits, and my field of\nvision grew distorted. I couldn\u2019t chase after her, so I kept her pinned down.\n\u201cThis is the worst\u2026 I\u2019m already\u2026 At my limit\u2026\u201d\nMy condition was bad before, but pushing myself so intensely had\nmade things hopeless. But I couldn\u2019t collapse here. My attack was\nsuperficial, not enough to knock her down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026 I thought you were involved.\u201d\nIbuki-san stood, wiping mud off her face.\n\u201cInvolved? In what?\u201d I asked.\nIbuki-san seemed to hesitate, but then muttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t burn the\nmanual.\u201d\n\u201cYou intend to keep lying even now?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would I gain by burning it? It was inevitable that people would\nbegin searching for the criminal after the uproar. Besides, people would\nsuspect me rather strongly. There was nothing to gain and a lot to lose.\u201d\n", "\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nI certainly agreed with what Ibuki-san said. She\u2019d stolen the keycard\nbefore the fire broke out. There wasn\u2019t enough time for her to deliberately\nburn the manual and fan the flames. But then, who did? What did burning the\nmanual mean?\n\u201cI talked to you in a roundabout way to confirm something. You seem\ndifferent. But I suppose this is probably really hard for you to swallow. Do\nyou think he\u2019s in Class D? There\u2019s a guy who figured me out before you\ndid.\u201d\nIbuki-san sighed as if exasperated.\n\u201cSo. You can\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d\nRight after I conjured the image of that person, I noticed that Ibuki-san\nhad disappeared. In the next instant, a blunt instrument slammed me in the\nhead, knocking me down hard.\n\u201cThis conversation is over.\u201d\nI had to get up, so I started to push myself. Ibuki-san lightly swept my\nhand with her right foot, causing me to fall back down. Ibuki-san grabbed my\nbangs and yanked me up.\n\u201cL-Let me go\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSorry. I\u2019ve got a lot to do.\u201d\nShe lightly slapped my cheek with her right hand. My mind and body\nwere at their limit, my movements clumsy, and it was impossible for me to\nstop her. I shook off the hand grasping my bangs. I tried to stand and close\nthe distance between us. But my feet got all tangled up and my strength was\nexhausted, causing me to collapse again.\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll permit such coercive methods?\u201d I muttered.\n\u201cCome on, now. I don\u2019t feel like answering that.\u201d\nWhen I drew nearer, she raised her leg high and kicked me in the face.\nHow many times would I repeat this same sentence? I\u2026made a huge\nmistake. By attempting to fix that mistake myself, I ended up turning it into a\nsituation that couldn\u2019t be fixed.\n", "6.9\nI let out  A deep breath while I stood over Horikita, who was\nunconscious. It had been a long since I\u2019d gone up against such a tough\nopponent. Had she been in better health, the match could\u2019ve gone either way.\nShe really was that strong. I resumed my work, and soon I\u2019d dug up a\nflashlight and a wireless transceiver wrapped in vinyl. I would have rather\ngotten by without using them if I could, though.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nRight after I took those two items out of the hole, I was overcome by\nsome mysterious sensation. I didn\u2019t know the cause of it. Somehow, the items\nseemed slightly different from when I had buried them.\n\u201cIs it because of the rain?\u201d\nI decided that I was probably just overthinking things, and used the\ntransceiver. I reported my current location to the man who\u2019d been waiting to\nhear about my whereabouts, and sat down to rest. About half an hour or so\npassed before I saw the gleam of a flashlight. It blinked twice, then three\ntimes. It was just like Morse code.\nI responded with the same signal, using the flashlight that had been\nnear my feet. The guiding light had gotten stronger, as if both lights were\nresonating with each other. Then I saw an irritating face that I didn\u2019t want to\nsee. Ryuuen appeared.\n\u201cYo. Excellent work, Ibuki. You did well.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally, yes?\u201d\n\u201cNaturally? If you hadn\u2019t made any mistakes until now, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave had to risk coming over here.\u201d\n\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be helped. I hadn\u2019t planned for the digital camera to\nbreak.\u201d\nIf only the digital camera hadn\u2019t broken, I would have taken a picture\nof the keycard and that would have been the end of it. I would have had my\ndefinitive proof. I wouldn\u2019t have even needed to call Ryuuen using the\ntransceiver. But instead, I\u2019d had to take a huge risk and hold onto the card,\n", "which led to Horikita discovering me.\n\u201cSo, where\u2019s the card?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\nI took it from my pocket and handed it over. Ryuuen shined his\nflashlight on the card and confirmed that the name \u201cHorikita Suzune\u201d was\nclearly engraved upon it.\n\u201cYou come over here and confirm it, too. That was your condition,\nremember? Relax, it\u2019s dark out, and this weather is horrible. There shouldn\u2019t\nbe anyone here. It\u2019s great to be cautious, but don\u2019t waste time.\u201d\nA man appeared from the shadows. Katsuragi, from Class A. He was\ndefinitely the calm and dependable type, the complete opposite of our leader.\nI pretended to be calm, but in my mind I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded again\nof Ryuuen\u2019s awfulness. Immediately after the test had started, Ryuuen told\nme that he would coax Class A into helping us. Apparently he\u2019d done it. But\nhow in the world?\nKatsuragi took Horikita\u2019s card from Ryuuen and looked it over it\ncarefully. You couldn\u2019t have made a fake or anything on this uninhabited\nisland.\n\u201cIt looks like the real thing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAre you convinced now?\u201d\nAlthough he\u2019d been shown definitive proof, Katsuragi\u2019s stern\nexpression didn\u2019t change. I\u2019d heard he was a cautious man, but to be this\nparanoid seemed like a unique kind of illness.\n\u201cYou managed to infiltrate Class D quite well. Weren\u2019t you\nsuspected?\u201d\n\u201cUnder normal circumstances, I would have been. But as for my\nmethods, that\u2019s a trade secret.\u201d\nI unconsciously rubbed my cheek. When we began our spy operation in\nClass D, Ryuuen slapped me to turn a lie into the truth. But the pain and the\nhatred I felt toward him were all quite real. Naturally, the students in Class D\nmisunderstood, and thought I\u2019d been beaten and chased out of my class.\nMaybe if I hadn\u2019t been injured, they wouldn\u2019t have swallowed the lie so\nsmoothly.\n", "\u201cDon\u2019t sit there and think about it forever. The situation is black-and-\nwhite, so make your decision. You\u2019re already halfway there. Don\u2019t do\nsomething as stupid as pulling out here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\nDespite that, it didn\u2019t seem like Katsuragi had given his consent.\nRyuuen noticed this, but rather than get annoyed, he smiled. As if he were\ngetting ready to attack his prey, he whispered, \u201cIf this wasn\u2019t an honorable\ndeed, then what are you going to do? Did you know that Sakayanagi\u2019s faction\nhas dominated ever since rumors spread that you failed to get on the student\ncouncil despite your best efforts? This might be your chance, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou bastard. Why are you telling me this?\u201d\n\u201cClass A maintains its position by forming alliances. If you can form\nthose, even those who have double-crossed you will return under your wing,\nwon\u2019t they? Or you could make me your enemy, I suppose? If you do, I\nwonder what would happen?\u201d\nKatsuragi hadn\u2019t signed a contract with the devil, but this was much\nmore than a simple negotiation. Well, perhaps that line of thinking was na\u00efve.\nOnce you discussed terms with the devil, you ended up making a contract one\nway or another.\n\u201cSakayanagi is absent. It\u2019s impossible for someone indecisive to rule\nClass A.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve established negotiations, as promised. I accept your proposal.\u201d\nWith that, Katsuragi stretched out his hand to Ryuuen, who smiled\naudaciously.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. You\u2019ve exercised sound judgment.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what negotiation? Would you explain?\u201d I asked.\nThey were free to do whatever they wanted, but I had a right to know\nthe details. When I aimed for Class A, I had to decide if being close to\nRyuuen was the right thing to do.\n\u201cTo form an alliance. With Class A.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be heading back now. I don\u2019t want to risk things by lingering for\ntoo long.\u201d Katsuragi returned the card to me, and disappeared into the\n", "darkness.\n\u201cWhat about the negotiation? What was discussed? What are we\ngetting in return?\u201d\nA flash of white lightning crackled through the air. Thunder came\ncrashing down immediately afterward, a roaring sound coming from the sea.\nRyuuen didn\u2019t even twitch an eyebrow. He told me the details of the contract\nwith a creepy smile on his face. The details weren\u2019t really complex, but they\nweren\u2019t simple, either.\nEven with our problems piling up one after the other, making it really\ndifficult to achieve anything, there was the promise of a huge return.\nEverything was going according to Ryuuen\u2019s plan, including the fact that\nmost of our students had retired. None of us had imagined this situation\nbefore the test had begun, when we were enjoying our holiday on the boat. I\nhated him so much that I wanted to die, but I supposed he was probably the\nman with abilities closest to those of Class A, after all. I had to acknowledge\nit.\n\u201cBut\u2026is there any guarantee Katsuragi will keep his promise? He\nmight renege.\u201d\n\u201cI have that covered, of course. He will have no choice but to honor his\npromise.\u201d\nI walked toward Horikita and, after carefully wiping my fingerprints\nfrom the keycard, stuck it back in her hand. There was nothing this girl could\nhave done. All she could do now was endure and keep silent until the end of\nthe test, all while knowing that Class C had discovered she was the leader.\nThis girl didn\u2019t trust anyone. Even after she knew the keycard had been\nstolen, she hadn\u2019t reported it to her classmates. Even though she\u2019d opened up\nher heart to Ayanokouji alone, he was a loner, too. If we factored in her\ncurrent incompetence, she wasn\u2019t any threat.\nBesides, if she had the keycard, then her mistake might not have been\nleaked to Class D yet. I understood her nature, to a certain extent. She was\npatient and stubborn, the type of person who didn\u2019t listen to other people\u2019s\nopinions. In other words, no matter how painful something was, she would\nendure it silently.\n\u201cUse your smarts to protect yourself.\u201d\n", "6.10\nI kicked off from the wet ground and chased Ibuki. The weather was a\nbothersome problem. If it got much worse, I might get stuck or have an\naccident. Also, the fact that the sun was going down earlier than I\u2019d\nanticipated made it difficult to push forward without a flashlight. The passing\nshowers grew even stronger, and the winds started to howl more violently.\nThe weather was just negative all around, no favorable points at all.\nI could only see a few meters ahead because of the pouring rain. Also,\nif I wandered onto any of the side roads, I\u2019d probably get lost. Thankfully,\ntwo pairs of footprints remained in the muddy ground and made it easy for\nme to follow after them. The footprints just suddenly stopped, though. No, on\nsecond glance, they didn\u2019t stop; they continued deeper into the forest.\nThe fact that the footprints suddenly took a sharp turn meant they\nhadn\u2019t gotten lost, but rather that they\u2019d intentionally ventured deeper into the\nforest. When I pointed my flashlight toward the depths of the forest, I saw the\ntwo pairs of footprints going deeper and deeper. There was no reason for\nthem to intentionally enter such a dangerous place.\nJust to be sure, I tried shining the flashlight on the route that led to the\nbeach, but there weren\u2019t any footprints. The ground was clear. I wiped away\nthe rain dripping from my bangs, and followed the footprints deeper into the\nforest. Naturally, my visibility got even worse. It was like night had already\nfallen. The atmosphere was creepy and dark, but I pushed forward, relying\nonly on the footprints.\nI continued forward for about thirty meters. Suddenly, a bright light\nentered my field of vision. I immediately turned the flashlight off and held\nmy breath. Looking in the direction of the light, I saw it shine once, then\ntwice more. A flashlight. It was almost as if someone were sending a signal.\nWas it Ibuki and Horikita? No, that wasn\u2019t it.\nNeither Ibuki nor Horikita should have had a light source on them. I\nquietly turned in the direction of the light and drew closer to the source. I\nheard people\u2019s voices, muffled by the rain, and hid myself. Their\nconversation sounded trivial. So as long as they didn\u2019t find me, getting a\ngrasp on the situation was secondary.\n", "Soon, the light moved further away. It was over, apparently. Just to be\nsure, I approached cautiously.\nNear a large tree lay a muddy Horikita. She\u2019d collapsed, unconscious.\nA single keycard lay on the ground near her hand. On her injured body were\ntraces of excavated soil. After examining the situation, I confirmed that more\npeople than Ibuki had discovered Horikita\u2019s position as leader. After picking\nup the keycard, I lifted Horikita into my arms.\n", "\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d\nHorikita let out a small sound. Slowly but surely, her eyes fluttered\nopen.\n\u201cAre you awake?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cAyano\u2026kouji-kun?\u201d\nShe sounded dazed, as if she couldn\u2019t understand the situation.\n\u201cAgh\u2026 My head\u2026hurts\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou have a high fever. Don\u2019t push yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026 I-Ibuki-san\u2026 But, why are you here?\u201d\nEven if I told her to sleep, Horikita wouldn\u2019t listen, all while her fever\ngrew worse. She started to understand the situation little by little.\n\u201cI knew it\u2026Ibuki-san stole my card.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t be dumber than Sudou-kun and the others.\u201d\nShe chastised herself and closed her eyes, as if lamenting a situation in\nwhich she was powerless.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a test where you can just hide for twenty-four hours a day,\nright? No matter what you do, you can be open to attack.\u201d\nI\u2019d intended to keep going, but it seemed like anything more would just\nmake the heartbroken Horikita even more depressed.\n\u201cI could\u2019ve avoided this if I knew how to rely on someone\u2026\u201d\nTo seriously protect the leader\u2019s identity, it was necessary to depend on\nallies that you trusted from the bottom of your heart. If you did that, you\ncould protect the card twenty-four hours a day. However, Horikita hadn\u2019t\nmade a single friend.\nShe kept muttering, \u201cI\u2019m so pathetic\u201d to herself quietly over and over.\n\u201cWhen I was losing consciousness, I felt like I could hear Ryuuen\u2019s\nvoice\u2026 It\u2019s strange, I thought he\u2019d already retired\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou were losing consciousness. Maybe you had a dream?\u201d\n\u201cIf it was a dream, it was a nightmare\u2026\u201d\n", "I wondered if she really had heard Ryuuen\u2019s voice. Even if she were\nasleep or losing consciousness, her brain had probably heard something. It\nwouldn\u2019t have been strange if she picked up Ryuuen\u2019s voice when\nunconscious.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\nWhile I was silently lost in thought, Horikita apologized.\n\u201cWhy are you apologizing to me?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one I can apologize to except for you\u2026\u201d\nHmm. That made me think pretty hard.\n\u201cIf you think things are bad, then make some reliable friends. Start\nthere first.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult advice\u2026 No one would want to be with me.\u201d\nIt sounded like she\u2019d resigned herself to unhappiness. Perhaps there\nwas a trace of masochism in her. I laughed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant to be made fun of, though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019ve started to sound like\nyou need allies.\u201d\n\u201cNobody would say that\u2026\u201d\nNormally, Horikita would have been insulting me, but right now her\nwords carried a different weight. She was blaming herself, or she wouldn\u2019t\nhave said something like that. Still, it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Horikita\u2019s\nhollow eyes seemed to look through rather than at me.\n\u201cI should have understood this a long time ago\u2026\u201d\nYou can\u2019t live alone in the world. School and society are composed of\na great many people.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk. You\u2019re sick.\u201d\nI tried to convince her to be quiet, but Horikita didn\u2019t stop. For\nHorikita, there had never been any choice but to rely on herself. She could\nhave chosen no other option.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to get up to Class A using my own abilities. I\u2019ll\ndefinitely recover from this failure\u2026\u201d Horikita weakly grabbed my sleeve as\n", "she appealed to me. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to be hated by everyone else\u2026 This was\nall my mistake.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to this school\u2019s system, if you fight by yourself, you won\u2019t\nreach Class A. We need to cooperate with our classmates. It\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d\nHorikita closed her eyes, as if lacking the strength to keep them open.\nHer grasp might have been weak, but I still felt it.\n\u201cI can\u2019t accept that. No matter how hard it is, I\u2019m still\u2026alone.\u201d\n\u201cAh, shut up already! Stop talking. Right now, you won\u2019t be able to\nconvince anyone.\u201d\nI embraced Horikita tightly.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bear every responsibility. You\u2019re not that strong,\nunfortunately.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me to give up? I have a dream to reach Class A, a\ndream for my brother to acknowledge me.\u201d\n\u201cNo one said you have to give up.\u201d\nI looked down at Horikita, who lightly groaned against my chest.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t fight by yourself, it\u2019s better to fight with a partner. I\u2019ll\nlend you a hand.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not the kind of person who would say such things\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, why then? I wonder.\u201d\nShortly afterward, her energy was spent, and Horikita lost\nconsciousness again. I had to carry her without anyone noticing. It would be\neasy to have her retire, but I didn\u2019t know which button on the wristwatch was\nfor emergencies. Besides, if the helicopter were suddenly dispatched, the\nsound would reverberate in the area.\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Did I pick the wrong path? Oh no, oh no!\u201d\nMy route had ended in a steep, sheer slope. If I took one step further, I\nwould fall. I tried shining a light below to see what it looked like about ten\nmeters down. Unfortunately, I\u2019d been walking in the wrong direction. Should\nI go back to the original route?\nI tried to change direction slowly, so as not to burden Horikita, but then\n", "right after\u2026\nThe soil underneath me collapsed, and I lost my balance. Alone, I\ncould have braced my legs and grasped the tree, but unfortunately, both of\nmy hands were occupied. I couldn\u2019t avoid falling. I curled up into a ball so I\ncould protect Horikita as we went tumbling down the slope. For several\nseconds, it was like flying. I don\u2019t remember very clearly what happened\nafterward.\nAt least Horikita hadn\u2019t been hurt, somehow. I looked up the slope, but\nwith the way things were now, it didn\u2019t seem like I could crawl back up while\ncarrying Horikita.\n\u201cWell, I sure messed up.\u201d\nHowever, this wasn\u2019t the time to accept defeat and die. Carrying the\nunconscious Horikita on my back, I ventured into the pitch-dark forest with a\nsingle flashlight. The rain poured down on us, mercilessly robbing me of my\nphysical strength. More than anything else, the heat radiating from Horikita\nwasn\u2019t normal. If she were exposed to the rain for any longer, it would\nbecome dangerous.\nHowever, we were deep in the forest. There were no caves or man-\nmade shelters. We had no choice but to rely on the power of nature.\nFortunately, the trees were lush and overgrown, and their branches might\nkeep our bodies relatively dry. I looked around the area, found a remarkably\nbig tree, and moved right under it. Of course, it didn\u2019t block the rain\ncompletely, but the overgrown leaves did stop a lot of the rainfall.\nI gently laid Horikita down. Her jersey was probably going to get dirty,\nbut we had bigger problems now. I sat there, with Horikita\u2019s head in my lap.\nIf only the area were cool\u2026 But the temperature was so high, hot and humid.\nHorikita occasionally trembled, like she was trying to curl into a ball.\nTrying to lessen her burden even a little, I held Horikita close to my\nchest. After some time had passed, Horikita woke up, sputtering out ragged\nbreaths. Still in a daze, Horikita wasn\u2019t able to understand our situation.\n\u201cWhy are you? I\u2026?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t seem to remember what had happened. I explained the\nwhole sequence of events. I had some doubts about whether she understood\neverything.\n", "\u201cI see\u2026 I remember.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cI remember my mistake, so it\u2019s probably awful.\u201d\nWell, if she was able to crack self-deprecating jokes, then I could\nprobably relax.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already almost six o\u2019clock, Horikita. You might think this will\nsound harsh, but you should retire. Your body is probably at its limit.\u201d\nShe had made it this far by pretending to be okay, but it wasn\u2019t possible\nfor her to carry on.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t afford to lose thirty points because of me\u2026 I\nwas the one who confronted Karuizawa-san and the others about using\npoints, right? It would make me look like such an idiot\u2026\u201d\nThe penalty for poor physical condition was severe. In points alone, it\nwas more than what Karuizawa had used herself. Horikita covered her eyes\nwith her arm, probably to hide her tears.\n\u201cNot just that\u2026 The keycard was stolen from me, too. You understand\nwhat that means?\u201d\n\u201cClass D will lose another fifty points.\u201d\nHorikita gave a slight nod. Class D would only be left with a few\npoints.\n\u201cJust leave me here and head back. If you do, I\u2019ll be the only one\nabsent from roll call.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\n\u201cBy tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll\u2026try to return by myself, somehow. If I\ncan deal with my poor health during roll call, then I\u2019ll do something about\nretirement.\u201d\nThat way, we would be left with a five-point loss.\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t that easy. You\u2019re feeling really weak now, and our\nteacher isn\u2019t kind enough to let you act your way past her. It will be\nimpossible for you to get back to camp on your own.\u201d\n\u201cStill, there\u2019s nothing else I can do\u2026 This is so Class D will have some\n", "points left.\u201d\nPutting aside the keycard incident, we might retain some points for roll\ncall and retirement. That certainly wasn\u2019t a small number.\n\u201cGo.\u201d\nAlthough Horikita was weak, I felt her indomitable will behind her\nwords. She could bear whatever burden she placed on herself, but couldn\u2019t\nseem to bear involving others. I rose, and rested her head against the tree. She\nwanted me to leave her.\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll leave. But if things continue like this, our classmates\nwill blame you.\u201d\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s the correct decision. Everything was my responsibility.\u201d\nHorikita praised my cold, calculating decision. She was ashamed of\nherself for being weak. Trembling, she forced herself to endure the cold. This\nwas the kind of hardship that solitary people faced. The weather was still\nstormy, with no signs that the rains and winds would stop.\n\u201cCan you really make it back alone by tomorrow morning?\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u201cHorikita. Do you really think that not retiring is the right decision?\u201d I\ncouldn\u2019t help blurting those words out.\n\u201cOf course I do. Retiring isn\u2019t an option for me.\u201d\nShe was free to exercise her indomitable will as much as she liked, but\nit didn\u2019t mean anything if she lost in the end.\n\u201cHey. Why do you think that we\u2019ve been backed into such a corner?\u201d I\nasked.\n\u201cI failed due to my negligence. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re completely wrong.\u201d\nHorikita Suzune had fought as hard as she could, and had tried to get to\nthe end of the test without making mistakes.\n\u201cGo\u2026 Because I think of you as my friend, please listen to my\nrequest\u2026\u201d\nAfter Horikita said that, she covered her mouth in surprise.\n", "\u201cI\u2019m going to make this right\u2026 As if it didn\u2019t happen at all.\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is the wrong choice.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can\u2026 By myself\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d\nHorikita suddenly stood, but the burden was too much. She closed her\neyes in pain.\n\u201cGo, please\u2026\u201d\nShe lost consciousness again. I gently took Horikita into my arms and\nshifted my position to make her a little more comfortable. Standing, I looked\nup at the boundless darkness and let out a sigh.\n\u201cIt would have been easier if you\u2019d just retired of your own free will.\u201d\nThe stubborn princess didn\u2019t seem like she was going to throw in the\ntowel. Wonderful. Yes, I thought it was wonderful. You were almost right.\nBut unfortunately, Horikita, you were wrong about one thing. Right now, just\nfor this moment, I\u2019ll tell you.\nI have never thought of you as my friend. I\u2019ve never cared about you as\na classmate. In this world, winning is everything. Your methods don\u2019t matter.\nI don\u2019t care what I have to sacrifice. As long as I have my victory in the end,\nI\u2019ll be fine.\nYou, Hirata\u2014no, all other people are nothing more than tools. I was\ncomplicit in what drove you to this. So, don\u2019t blame yourself, Horikita. You\nwere useful to me.\n", "I walked down the muddy road, shining my flashlight on the path. My\nshoes were already covered in mud and filled with water. But I didn\u2019t care\nabout that. First, I needed to get an understanding of the location.\nWhen I went down the slope, I\u2019d undoubtedly gotten further away from\nClass D\u2019s base camp. But I was sure that if I turned the other way, the beach\nwould be near. I could press on and walk through the woods for several days,\nrelying on the map in my head.\n\u201cIt was close, after all.\u201d\nEventually, I arrived at the beach. The ship was floating in the water,\nand the lights were on. It took a few minutes, but I returned to the place I\u2019d\nleft. Horikita had collapsed. She remained unconscious as I picked her up in\nmy arms. Her beautiful face was splashed with mud.\nI started walking toward the beach, rather than our base camp.\nSomehow, I had managed to make it on time. It was just around seven\no\u2019clock in the evening. The teachers\u2019 tents had been taken down to avoid\nbeing blown away by the wind.\nI went up the ramp to the pier and reached the ship\u2019s deck. One of the\nteachers noticed and raced up to me.\n\u201cYou\u2019re prohibited from entering here. You\u2019ll be disqualified.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an emergency. She\u2019s got a high fever and has lost\nconsciousness. Please let her rest right away.\u201d\nOnce I explained the situation, the teacher skipped the instructions and\nbrought out a stretcher. I laid Horikita down.\n\u201cIs she okay with retiring?\u201d\n\u201cWithout question. However, allow me to confirm one thing. Because\nit isn\u2019t eight o\u2019clock yet, this shouldn\u2019t have any effect on roll call, correct?\u201d\nIt was 7:58. I was cutting it close, but we should be safe. I needed to\nget the teacher\u2019s promise, though.\n\u201cYou are certainly right. It is quite close. However, you\u2019re out.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. Oh, one more thing. I\u2019d like to return this keycard.\u201d\nI took the keycard from my pocket and handed it over.\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll be heading back.\u201d\n", "I couldn\u2019t stay any longer, so I went back to the beach while the rain\nwas still falling. With this, Class D would lose thirty points due to Horikita\u2019s\nretirement, and an additional five points due to my absence during roll call.\n", "Chapter 7:\nThe Curtain Rises\nAugust 7th. It was finally time for our short stint on the uninhabited\nisland to come to an end. Our minor saving grace was that we hadn\u2019t spent\nour time rigorously fighting to survive. At least we\u2019d had a moderate amount\nof fun? There still wasn\u2019t any sign of Mashima-sensei or the others, even\nwhen the test ended around noon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now tallying up the test results. Please wait a moment. Feel free\nto use the rest area if you would like, or have a drink.\u201d\nAfter that announcement, the students gathered together and headed\ntoward the rest area. Underneath the provisional tents, they\u2019d prepared tables\nand chairs for our use, so we could get comfortable. There were no signs that\nKouenji, Horikita, or any of the retired students were waiting on the cruise\nship. Sudou, always together with Ike and Yamauchi, looked up at the ship.\n\u201cAyanokouji. You work pretty well with Horikita, don\u2019t you? How\nclose are you, really?\u201d\nRather than sounding angry or upset, Sudou sounded like he genuinely\nwanted to know.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between us. We\u2019re just friends. Nothing more,\nnothing less.\u201d\n\u201cEven that makes me jealous, though. I still ain\u2019t her friend.\u201d Sudou\nsounded a little frustrated.\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t Horikita acknowledge you a little bit this time?\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t caused any trouble. Rather, he\u2019d acted for the sake of the\nclass by trying to save Horikita and taking the initiative to fish.\n\u201cI sure hope so. She still hasn\u2019t called me by my first name, after all.\u201d\n\u201cGood work, both of you. Thank you for everything you did this week.\nYou really saved us.\u201d Hirata appeared with words of gratitude. He handed me\none of two paper cups he had. The cup cooled my palm. He handed the other\nto Sudou.\n", "\u201cI should be thanking you. You covered for me, the class loner. Also,\nyou covered for me being late for roll call, and the fact that Horikita retired.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t blame you when I heard the reason. Besides, Horikita-san\ngave us some really important information.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe what she said?\u201d\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t the type to speak irresponsibly. That\u2019s why you get along\nwith her, right?\u201d\nThis guy would protect an ally even if it meant risking his pure\nreputation.\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said there wasn\u2019t any risk, but I had to help Horikita-\nsan.\u201d\nHirata softly added, \u201cThat\u2019s a friend.\u201d It seemed like there was a faint\ntrace of the smile I saw yesterday. Sudou tilted in his head in confusion, as if\nunable to understand what we were talking about.\n\u201cWait, what did you say? What are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll understand pretty soon. Anyway, Class C is really\nstrange\u2026 They\u2019re on another level.\u201d\nBecause most of the Class C students had retired on the second day of\nthe test, there wasn\u2019t anyone here. I saw no sign of Ibuki anywhere on the\nsandy beach, as if she\u2019d retired as well. I saw a rather bizarre sight: Ryuuen\nalone, the only remaining student from Class C.\n\u201cWhy is he\u2026? So Ryuuen-kun didn\u2019t retire?\u201d\nWhile Hirata and I tried figure out the situation, Ryuuen turned toward\nus, as if he noticed our stares. He slowly drew nearer, as if thinking of\nsomething. The tension started to rise.\n\u201cOh, hey there, sycophants. What happened to Suzune?\u201d said Ryuuen\nas he drew closer, a paper cup in hand, completely ignoring Hirata\u2019s\npresence.\nAfter Sudou heard the name \u201cSuzune\u201d cross Ryuuen\u2019s lips, the veins in\nhis head bulged, and he shot Ryuuen a glare.\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve been chasing Suzune\u2019s ass. We were together before,\nyou know.\u201d Ryuuen, having drained the contents of his paper cup, lightly\n", "crushed it and threw it at my feet. \u201cThrow that away for me.\u201d\nSudou trampled on and kicked the paper cup as hard as he could.\n\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say. Huh? Pick up your own trash, jerk.\u201d\n\u201cBut picking up garbage seems like the perfect task for garbage.\u201d\nRyuuen didn\u2019t show any signs that he cared, in contrast to Sudou, who\nlooked ready to blow his stack.\n\u201cCalm down, Sudou-kun. Here, I\u2019ll throw it away.\u201d\nWhile Hirata hurriedly picked up the cup, Sudou clicked his tongue and\nkicked at the sand. Ryuuen looked away, as if we were boring. His torso had\ngotten dirty, and his trousers and jersey were covered in filth. It was an\nunimaginable state for him, since he had groaned about how much he loathed\nhard work.\n\u201cI thought you retired, Ryuuen-kun.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you? More importantly, where\u2019s Suzune? I\u2019ve dreamed of\nsqueezing her bottom.\u201d\nThat was the second time he\u2019d said \u201cSuzune.\u201d Coupled with his coarse\nlanguage, it was too much. Sudou approached Ryuuen, grabbing him by the\ncollar.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nRyuuen showed no signs of agitation. He met Sudou\u2019s intense glare\nwith ease.\n\u201cThe next time you say something stupid, I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Sudou\ngrowled.\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s with you? Getting all excited by yourself, huh?\u201d\nFists were about to fly, so Hirata jumped in and pulled Sudou away\nfrom Ryuuen.\n\u201cHorikita-san retired yesterday. She\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\u201cRetired? Suzune? She doesn\u2019t seem like that kind of girl.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u00be\u201d\nJust then, we heard the click of a megaphone being turned on.\nMashima-sensei appeared on the beach. The first-year students hurriedly tried\n", "to form a line, but Mashima-sensei waved his hands at them to stop.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t mind if you want to keep relaxing. The test has\nalready concluded. Now we\u2019ve entered the summer vacation part of the trip,\nso it\u2019s all right if you loosen up.\u201d\nEven though he\u2019d said that, tensions were naturally running high for\nthe students. They all stopped their chatter in an instant.\n\u201cOver this past week, we, your teachers, have closely watched your\nefforts in this special test. There were some students who took on the\nchallenge honestly, head-on. There were some who devised schemes to tackle\nthe test. Many things have happened, but overall, the test results were\nsplendid. Good work.\u201d\nThe students appeared relieved to receive such straightforward praise\nfrom Mashima-sensei. It seemed like everyone was finally starting to believe\nthe one-week test was really over.\n\u201cWell then, to get straight to the point. I would like to announce the\nresults of the special test.\u201d\nThere probably wasn\u2019t a single person, not even our own homeroom\nteacher, who had seen these test results.\n\u201cWe will not accept any questions regarding the results, no exceptions.\nWe would like you to accept the results you have been given, analyze them,\nand use them to help you for the next test. It is what it is. Don\u2019t wet\nyourselves over these results. You must accept reality, you know?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we should be saying to you Class C people. You used up\nall of your points, right? Don\u2019t make us laugh.\u201d Sudou poked fun at Class C\u2019s\nreckless behavior.\n\u201cWe have 125 points remaining. I think we\u2019ll be quite fine,\u201d Hirata\nsaid.\nHe said so proudly, probably irritated by Ryuuen\u2019s provocation.\nRyuuen responded by making a gesture that looked like he was vomiting.\n\u201cHa. I\u2019m jealous of the nerve of you small fry. How you can be\nsatisfied with that amount of points\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whatever you say; Class C is still going to stay\nat zero points.\u201d\n", "\u201cHeh heh heh. Don\u2019t be hasty. It\u2019s certainly true we used up 300 points.\nHowever, have you forgotten the additional rules of this test?\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to expose a class leader?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I wrote it on the paper, didn\u2019t I? The name of Class D\u2019s\nleader.\u201d\nHirata and I tried to not show any emotion, but Sudou looked shocked.\n\u201cAlso, those guys in A and B wrote the same thing, too. Do you know\nwhat this means?\u201d Ryuuen said.\n\u201cHold on a minute. What are you talking about, huh?! I-If you\u2019re\ntelling the truth, then\u2026\u201d\nThen Class D would be hit with penalties, and we would lose 100\npoints. Mashima-sensei\u2019s voice sounded through the megaphone.\n\u201cNow, we will announce the rankings. The lowest class is\u00beClass C,\nwith zero points.\u201d\n\u201cBwah ha ha ha! Hey, check it out! You guys have zero points after\nall!\u201d\nWhen Sudou heard the results, he clutched his stomach in mocking\nlaughter.\n\u201cZero?\u201d\nRyuuen didn\u2019t seem to understand the situation. Mashima-sensei\ncontinued the announcements matter-of-factly.\n\u201cIn third place is Class A, with 120 points. Coming in second place is\nClass B, with 140 points.\u201d\nA commotion broke out. No one had expected the rankings or the point\ntotals.\n\u201cAnd then, Class D\u2026\u201d\nFor an instant, Mashima-sensei\u2019s movements stiffened. However, he\nsoon resumed speaking.\n\u201c\u2026has come in first with 225 points. This concludes the\nannouncement.\u201d\nAll of the students in Class D, save Hirata, were probably more\n", "confused than anyone else. Even Hirata, who was the only one in the know,\nwas still almost unable to believe it. He wore an exuberant smile.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this, Katsuragi?!\u201d\nVoices saying such things echoed from one end of the rest area to the\nother. Class A students circled around Katsuragi.\n\u201cSomething is strange\u2026 What does this mean?\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cYahoo! We did it! In your face!\u201d\nAs Sudou shouted for joy, all of the Class D students gathered together.\n\u201cHey, hey, hey, what\u2019s going on?! Hey, hey!!\u201d\nIke, filled with both excitement and confusion, asked Hirata for an\nexplanation.\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything. Well, Ryuuen-kun, if you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d\nWith those final words, Hirata walked toward the boat alongside Ike\nand Sudou. Sudou raised his middle finger while sticking out his tongue.\nRyuuen could do nothing but watch in silence.\nThe exam was over, and the first-year students scattered. The ship was\ngoing to depart in two hours, and although we were free to play in the sea, we\nwere also free to go onto the ship. I walked aboard.\n\u201cHello, ladies and gentlemen. How was your week on the deserted\nisland?\u201d Kouenji, on the ship\u2019s deck with a drink in hand, greeted Class D.\n\u201cYou jerk, Kouenji! We lost thirty points because of you. You know\nwhat I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cCalm down, little boy Ike. I was in poor health, and was resting. I had\nno other choice.\u201d\nHis skin looked smooth and glossy, so it was easy to tell that he had\nspent the week tanning. Also, his evidently perfect health made him sound\nnot the least bit credible. While the guys joined forces to yell at Kouenji as\none, Horikita appeared. She was still pale, not in good health yet. The\nstudents noticed her presence, and naturally gathered around her.\n\u201cS-Suzune. Are you feeling better now?\u201d\nSudou tripped over his words a bit, but he approached Horikita and\n", "called her by her first name, just as he\u2019d practiced.\n\u201cI\u2019m not too bad. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m back to full health. More than\nanything else, retiring was a big mistake on my part.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nHorikita had accepted being called by her first name rather naturally.\nThat was unexpected.\n\u201cBy the way, Sudou-kun. Don\u2019t just go around calling me by my first\nname without permission. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cY-y-yeah.\u201d\nOr not. Sudou couldn\u2019t offer resistance. All he could do was nod.\n\u201cBut\u2026what happened? Why was Class D ranked first?\u201d\nOur leader\u2019s identity had been exposed, so I\u2019d made Horikita retire.\nCalculating, I supposed that would have gotten us incredibly close to zero\npoints.\n\u201cTh-that\u2019s right. What happened, Hirata?! I don\u2019t get it at all!\u201d\nKaruizawa asked.\nBefore Hirata could answer, something needed to be resolved.\n\u201cWell, Karuizawa-san, I think you should talk to Horikita-san first,\ndon\u2019t you agree?\u201d\nKaruizawa drew closer to Horikita.\n\u201cHorikita-san, do you have a minute?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes. There\u2019s something that we\u2019re supposed to talk about. Right?\u201d\nHorikita, seeing Karuizawa nod, closed her eyes. She was thinking of\nthe underwear theft, and how she\u2019d accused Karuizawa of spending points\nselfishly while her own identity as the leader had been discovered and she\u2019d\nretired. She had no choice but to eat some humble pie now.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nKaruizawa said it somewhat bluntly, but with sincerity.\n\u201cIbuki-san stole my underwear. Ayanokouji-kun told us everything.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n", "Horikita had prepared herself for abuse, so she was puzzled when she\nreceived an apology.\n\u201cHorikita-san, when you noticed that Ibuki-san was the culprit, she\ntried to run because you questioned her, right? That\u2019s why you ended up\ncollapsing and getting sick\u2026\u201d\nHorikita suddenly turned toward me, shocked by Karuizawa\u2019s words. I\nfelt kind of awkward for some reason, and averted my eyes.\n\u201cI heard about it from Hirata-kun first. He said that you found out the\nleaders of Class A and C. That\u2019s why we had so many points. So, I\u2019m\u2026sorry\nfor everything I said.\u201d\nKaruizawa immediately returned to the other girls.\n\u201cWait a minute. I\u2026 You said I found out the leaders\u2019 identities? But I\nretired\u00be\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be humble, Horikita-san. We won because\nyour answers were absolutely correct.\u201d\nDoubts seemed to swirl in Horikita\u2019s head. It seemed like the\nmysterious test results made sense to everyone except her.\n\u201cWait. Ayanokouji-kun, what did you\u00be\u201d\nHorikita called to me in the midst of all the joy and confusion.\nHowever, being the key player in our victory, she was now surrounded by a\ngreat number of classmates.\n\u201cHorikita-san, you were so incredibly awesome! You\u2019re seriously a\ngenius, you know that?!\u201d\n\u201cWhen I heard that you\u2019d retired I wondered what was going to\nhappen, but everything turned out okay!\u201d\n\u201cW-wait a second!\u201d\nShe was bombarded with questions from boys and girls alike. I clasped\nmy hands and prayed for her safety while I made my retreat. Whew, I was\nsure glad how things ended up. Our class took first place and Horikita gained\nin popularity. Considering her natural poise, she\u2019d probably get through it\njust fine. I wanted to avoid getting caught up in the rejoicing, so I went to my\nroom to rest. As I walked away, I was confronted by a goddess of death yet\n", "again.\n\u201cMay I have a word with you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel sociable. Is it okay if I refuse, Chabashira-sensei?\u201d\n\u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to, I can just start talking here. You don\u2019t\nmind if we stand outside, do you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hot, so please keep it brief.\u201d\nI had walked to the other side of the ship, so Chabashira-sensei took the\nlead. We found a place where there weren\u2019t any people around and it was\ncompletely quiet before we started talking.\n\u201cIs it safe to say that for the time being, you\u2019re satisfied?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYes. First, I\u2019d like to say that you did wonderfully. I\u2019m honestly\nimpressed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, tell me something. Is it really true? Did he demand I be expelled\nfrom school?\u201d\nChabashira-sensei leaned against the railing and looked toward the sky.\n\u201cDo you have any basis for saying that the story is true?\u201d\n\u201cI know quite a lot about you. Might not that be the reason, more than\nanything else? Other teachers don\u2019t know about your true abilities. But I have\nno doubts.\u201d\nI certainly had my doubts. It was true that I stood out because of the\nentrance examination, but it shouldn\u2019t have been something all the teachers\nhad inside knowledge of. But still, the sequence of events was rather odd.\nChabashira-sensei had said that man had contacted the school directly. As\nexpected, this person was hiding something.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve heard of this rather famous myth, the wings of\nIcarus.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you bring that up?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIcarus flew out of the tower where he was imprisoned in order to gain\nhis freedom. However, that wasn\u2019t achieved through one person\u2019s abilities\nalone. It was because his father, Daedalus, had constructed wings and\ninstructed him to fly. He didn\u2019t fly because of his own intentions. Don\u2019t you\nthink that sounds exactly like your current predicament?\u201d\n", "\u201cI can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cThat man\u2014no, your father\u2014said this: \u2018Sooner or later, Kiyotaka will\ngladly chase the means of his expulsion from school.\u2019 You\u2019re welcoming\nyour end, much like how Icarus fell into the sea and died after his wings were\nburned, because he\u2019d flown too close to the sun.\u201d\nThe wings of Icarus, huh?\n\u201cSo, what do you plan to do?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYou should know, Sensei. Icarus won\u2019t heed Daedalus\u2019 warnings.\u201d\nEven though his wings burned, Icarus flew as high as he could in\nsearch of his freedom.\n", "7.1\nAfter I returned to the ship, I went back to my room right away. An\nexhausted Hirata was there, asleep on his side. I changed my clothes quietly\nso I wouldn\u2019t wake him and headed into the hall. When I turned my phone\nback on, the ringer started buzzing repeatedly. My call history had filled up.\nThey were all from Horikita. Scary. For the time being, I just answered\nemails and relaxed in the lounge while I waited.\nShe probably wouldn\u2019t be convinced unless I explained things. Soon, a\nquite angry Horikita met up with me, radiating a silent pressure.\n\u201cWhat do these test results mean? What in the world happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou look like you don\u2019t have any idea at all.\u201d\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine it. I don\u2019t understand it at all. I have a mountain of\nquestions.\u201d\nHorikita ordered a drink from an attendant. I started talking.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything. However, my one condition is that you stay\nquiet on this matter. I won\u2019t compromise on this.\u201d\nI\u2019d assumed it would come to this, considering Horikita hadn\u2019t retired\nof her own will. This story was for Horikita\u2019s ears only.\n\u201cWhat would you like to ask?\u201d\n\u201cWhat were you doing during the test? Tell me,\u201d she said.\nThat was a much better question than I\u2019d expected. She wanted to hear\neverything at once.\n\u201cWhen the special test was announced, I didn\u2019t focus on anything\nexcept for the additional rules. I roughly understood how to manage the 300\npoints, but you couldn\u2019t manipulate them as an individual.\u201d\n\u201cBut the additional rules were really difficult to understand. If you did\nthings normally, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to identify the leaders. Right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. First of all, I volunteered to join the search for the base camp.\nAble to move freely, I planned to search out spot locations ahead of everyone\nelse.\u201d\n", "\u201cYou make it sound simple, but no one should have known the spot\nlocations.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You didn\u2019t understand because you were ill and holed\nup inside the ship, but the school already gave us hints about the locations\nwhen we were sailing around the island.\u201d\nKatsuragi had also noticed this when the ship circled the island at an\nunusually fast speed. Horikita fell silent. The ship had been traveling nearly\nthree times faster than a usual cruise ship. Besides, if it were just for\nsightseeing, it wasn\u2019t normal to use a strange expression like \u201csignificant\nscenery.\u201d\nKouenji had noticed this hint, too. Well, it was probably a waste of\ntime thinking about Kouenji, anyway.\n\u201cThen, I reached the cave. I thought it was the most important base.\u201d\n\u201cThe cave was the most important base? Don\u2019t you think that the river\nand the well would have been more convenient, though?\u201d\n\u201cThe spot itself wasn\u2019t what was important. Its location was.\u201d\nThere were no spots close to the river or the well. However, there were\ntwo spots near the cave: the hut and the tower. It was the perfect place to\nexercise control. Horikita looked like she understood once I explained.\n\u201cBut what advantage is there in going into the cave if you don\u2019t have a\nkeycard?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d intended to explore various things, but in the end I\ndiscovered the leader\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose that Katsuragi-kun was careless.\u201d\nNo, that wasn\u2019t it.\n\u201cThere was that guy, Yahiko, remember? The one following Katsuragi\naround? He was the leader. I saw Katsuragi and Yahiko at the cave, but I\ndidn\u2019t see the moment they occupied it. After the two of them walked away, I\nchecked if the cave was occupied or not.\u201d\nI explained the situation. When I saw them, Katsuragi had been\nstanding near the entrance with the card in his hand. Yahiko came out of the\ncave, and they left together.\n", "\u201cWouldn\u2019t you have mistaken Katsuragi-kun as the leader?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cDo you think that the leader would have shown off the card so\ncarelessly in front of people?\u201d\nHorikita should have known how unbelievably stupid that was,\nprecisely because she\u2019d been appointed as the leader.\n\u201cBut why? Why bother deliberately holding onto the card, then?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t have any other choice. As far as I can tell,\nKatsuragi is a calm and collected man, excessively cautious. There\u2019s no way\nhe didn\u2019t understand the high risk of occupying a spot immediately after\nfinding it. In other words, the person who occupied it was enticed by short-\nsighted greed.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026why there was another person.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d When Katsuragi found the cave, he didn\u2019t intend to occupy it.\nNevertheless, he was holding the space down, probably because Yahiko had\nbeen careless. Even though he thought no one would be watching them, he\u2019d\nprobably wanted insurance. By holding onto the card and displaying it, even\nin the unlikely event that a witness was present, he could mislead them into\nthinking that he was the leader.\n\u201cSo, aside from their base, Class A held down at least two spots, but\nwe didn\u2019t confirm how many they were occupying by the end of the test. If I\ncorrectly guessed the identity of their leader, though, I could invalidate all of\ntheir points.\u201d\nAfter I\u2019d narrowed it down to Yahiko, putting effort into anything else\nwould\u2019ve been a waste of time.\n\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced. If he figured out the spot\u2019s location at such an\nearly stage, and if he were acting alongside a lot of other people, shouldn\u2019t he\nhave avoided trouble? Even if he just had someone standing watch by the\ncave, it should have been sufficient claim of ownership. Why would they\noccupy it?\u201d\n\u201cThat was probably Class A\u2019s disadvantage.\u201d\nTheir overall points on the test were high, and they didn\u2019t receive a\nnegative assessment due to behavior in class like Class D. However, their\nclass was divided internally. In other words, there was a reason why\n", "Katsuragi couldn\u2019t rely on other people.\n\u201cTheir class appears perfect at first glance, but it actually has a huge\nschism in it.\u201d\nThat was why my methods had revealed Class A so easily. Well, that\nwas simple luck. It was like getting a good score by exploiting a mistake.\nClass A wasn\u2019t vigilantly watching for a surprise attack from overhead, so\nthere was nothing to be done.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I excluded Class A at that stage, and turned my attention\ntoward Class C. Katsuragi was easy to understand, but with Ryuuen, there\nwere many unknown variables. To tell you the truth, he was gathering more\ninformation than I was. He\u2019d found out the identities of all of the leaders.\u201d\n\u201cW-wait, he found out the identities of all of the leaders\u2026 So not only\nClass D, but also the leaders for Classes B and A? But that\u2019s strange. We\nwere far from being penalized; we ended up getting first place by a wide\nmargin. How do you intend to explain that?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a little difficult to explain, but the reason I made you retire is\nthe answer.\u201d\n\u201cWait, the answer is you made me retire? What in the world did you\ndo?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that reminds me. I didn\u2019t return it to the school yet.\u201d\nI took a single card out of my pocket and handed it over to Horikita.\n\u201cThis is a keycard. Why do you\u2026?!\u201d\nHorikita was astonished when she saw the letters engraved on the card.\n\u201cWait, why does\u2026?\u201d\nThe name read \u201cAyanokouji Kiyotaka.\u201d\n\u201cThe test had to be fair. The rules were fundamentally created to be\nfair.\u201d\nThat was quite natural, something you would have seen if you\u2019d\ncarefully confirmed the additional rules. Only one person could be chosen as\nleader. The leader could not be changed. Only the leader held the rights of\nexclusive possession.\n\u201cWhat do you think would happen if the leader retired because of poor\n", "health?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 The leader would be absent. So the rights of exclusive\npossession would disappear\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWrong. In the manual, it says, \u2018It is impossible to change the leader\nwithout suitable justification.\u2019 Don\u2019t you think that retirement is suitable\nenough justification?\u201d\nIt seemed like the additional rules had been made to be broken if\nsomeone were absent due to poor health or injury. I could predict setting up a\nnew leader. I was able to figure this out by looking at the other rules. For\nexample, we couldn\u2019t change the base camp without suitable justification\nafter we\u2019d first decided where it would be, but there were suitable reasons.\nWe\u2019d occupied the riverside area, but if we were careless and it was\ntaken by another class, then that would have counted as \u201csuitable\njustification.\u201d You couldn\u2019t stay in the base itself, so if there wasn\u2019t a system\nwhere you could search for a new base camp, everything would collapse.\n\u201cSo then, you made me\u2026?\u201d\nHorikita Suzune had retired, and I was appointed in her place. Of\ncourse, that meant that I was the leader they were supposed to guess at the\nend of the test. There can only be one.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why even though Class C knew you were the leader, we\navoided penalties.\u201d\n\u201cBut wait. Ibuki-san stole my card, but what if I\u2019d protected it really\nthoroughly?\u201d\nHorikita recalled the day of the accident.\n\u201cDid you drop the card on purpose back then? Well, I suppose that\nYamauchi-kun\u2019s actions might have provided Ibuki-san the opportunity to\nhatch a plan to steal the keycard\u2026\u201d\nI\u2019d been holding onto the muddy Horikita, so in that sense I had no\nchoice but to give up the keycard.\n\u201cUnless I knew what Ibuki-san was aiming for right at the start, I\ncouldn\u2019t have done anything\u2026\u201d\nRight. Ibuki had been picked up by Class D purely by chance. I\u2019d been\n", "almost convinced until I heard about the guy named Kaneda in Class B. He\u2019d\nbeen sent as a spy by Ryuuen. I wasn\u2019t so good-natured as to believe that two\npeople just happened to be saved by two separate classes completely by\nchance.\n\u201cBesides, Ibuki has a habit of looking people in the eye when she\u2019s\nlying.\u201d\nYou could say that the bigger the lie, the more obvious the habit.\n\u201cWait, when she lied she would look the person in the eye? Isn\u2019t it\nusually the opposite?\u201d\n\u201cGenerally speaking, you avoid eye contact if you have a guilty\nconscience. However, it was the opposite for her. I think that she made eye\ncontact to make the person think that the lie was the truth. She probably\ndidn\u2019t even notice it herself.\u201d\nEven when we were talking about the underwear theft, she looked me\nstraight in the eye.\n\u201cHer goal was probably to find the keycard, but she might have\nintended to disrupt Class D at the same time.\u201d\nWhat had happened to Karuizawa, and the underwear in Ike\u2019s bag,\nmight have otherwise been seen as mere coincidence.\n\u201cBut I have to wonder why Ibuki-san specifically stole my keycard. All\nshe needed was to check my name.\u201d\n\u201cThat was likely Ibuki\u2019s intention from the start. However, she ran into\nunexpected trouble.\u201d\nThat was the catalyst that led to verifying the leader of Class C.\n\u201cIbuki had a digital camera in her bag to take a picture of the keycard.\u201d\n\u201cTo take a picture\u2026with the camera? Why would she go so far?\u201d\n\u201cIf she had a picture, then the leader\u2019s identity would have been clear\nfor anyone to see, right? If she had convincing evidence, she would have\nprofited.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand\u2026 Did Ryuuen-kun not trust Ibuki-san?\u201d\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t it. If the discussion only stayed within Class C, then there\nshouldn\u2019t have been any need for her to take a picture with the camera or\n", "steal the card.\u201d\nIn other words, that meant there had been people involved who didn\u2019t\ntrust Ibuki\u2019s words alone; they\u2019d wanted reliable evidence.\n\u201cFrom here on out, I don\u2019t have any evidence of what I\u2019m saying.\nThink of it as my intuition, which I derived from the test results. At the end\nof the test, Class A had 270 points.\u201d\nIn other words, they hadn\u2019t used a single point during the test.\n\u201cClasses A and C were connected, working together behind the scenes.\nClass C sacrificed their own points and bought whatever Class A needed.\nAlso, by taking all of C\u2019s tools, Class A was able to spend the week without\nusing any points.\u201d\nIbuki had obtained evidence and given it to someone in A Class.\n\u201cBy the way, I became aware of Class C\u2019s leader after half of the\nstudents retired. It was certain that the leader would have remained on the\nisland, right?\u201d\n\u201cEven so, we weren\u2019t supposed to know who was left.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I was almost one hundred percent sure that Ryuuen was still on\nthe island.\u201d\nI figured it out when I saw Ibuki hiding a wireless transceiver in the\nground. Ibuki had used it to stay in contact with Ryuuen. Retired students\nshouldn\u2019t have been able to use a transceiver. In other words, someone was\nleft on the island for her to communicate with.\nHe\u2019d casually set the transceiver on top of a table while enjoying his\nvacation. No one else was controlling it, just him. His mistake was that he\ndidn\u2019t trust anyone.\n\u201cMy god\u2026 I don\u2019t even have the words,\u201d Horikita answered, facing\nthe truth.\nIf I were to summarize this test, I\u2019d say that Class A\u2019s first mistake\ncarried through to the end. They didn\u2019t function well due to an internal rift.\nClass B went through the test with a thoroughly defense-oriented strategy,\nwhich did neither harm nor good. Their only mistake was that, because there\nwere so many good-natured people in Class B, they\u2019d permitted Kaneda to\nstay, and they\u2019d believed him.\n", "I don\u2019t know how Kaneda got the evidence, but he\u2019d obtained\nsomething, and probably told Ryuuen. If you looked at the fact that Class A\ndidn\u2019t get any points, you might think it was because they hadn\u2019t obtained\nany physical evidence. Then there was Class C. We were able to avoid\ndamage because I\u2019d been appointed as the leader. In addition to sending\npeople off as spies to find out the identities of the other leaders, Class C had\nprofited from some kind of negotiations with Class A. Ryuuen might be our\nnumber one enemy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like this. You completely used me, like a pawn.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t deny that. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you never want to\nspeak to me ever again.\u201d\nI was aware of what I\u2019d done.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be heading back to my room now. I\u2019m really tired,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWait. We\u2019re not done talking.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? I just want to relax in my room, if possible.\u201d\n\u201cAfter you explain everything. There are still some things we need to\ntalk about, right?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026like what?\u201d\n\u201cThe reason why you participated in this special test. Was it to fight\nalone? I don\u2019t care that you used me this time. I want to know why you put in\nthe effort when you dislike trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder.\u201d\nPerhaps the explanation I had given so far had been less important to\nHorikita.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any room for doubt. I understand your talents now. If you\nhelp me, aiming for Class A seems a realistic enough goal. But what are your\nprinciples? Why did you do this?\u201d\nOf course, I didn\u2019t want to talk to Horikita about my personal\nproblems. I\u2019d only participated because of a commitment I made to\nChabashira-sensei.\n\u201cBecause I was touched that you tried to fight all alone when you were\nill.\u201d\n", "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t normally say that kind of thing. It\u2019s easy to spot the\nlie.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what I mean is I don\u2019t feel like explaining it.\u201d\nI stood up and stretched out my hand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind helping you get up to Class A. However, I have one\ncondition. Do not investigate me. If you promise not to touch on this subject\never again, I will help you.\u201d\nHorikita took my hand without hesitation.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk, there\u2019s nothing I can really do about that. If\nyou\u2019ll help, I have no reason to refuse you. I\u2019m not interested in digging\nthings up that are better left buried. After all, you dislike trouble.\u201d\nHorikita\u2019s handshake was firm. I work for me. You do things for\nyourself. The battle to raise our class up from the very bottom was about to\nbegin.\n", "Postscript\nHello, this is Syougo Kinugasa. I\u2019ve started to become health-\nconscious. There\u2019s been a sake boom recently, so I\u2019ve been drinking one cup\na day, and making sure to relax.\nAnyway, in the third volume we begin to understand the goals and\npolicies of each individual class, centered on the special test. The\nprotagonist\u2019s way of thinking and his classmates\u2019 ways of thinking gradually\nbecome clear.\nEven in modern society, problems arise from the differences in opinion\nbetween men and women. As long as the human race continues to evolve, I\ndon\u2019t think there will ever be a perfect solution for the inequalities based on\ngender.\nWell then, do you remember? In Volume 2, my goal was to have\nShunaku-shi treat me to sashimi. Of course, I remembered. Maguuroo! It was\nincredibly delicious. Thank you very much. Please, let\u2019s continue to be good\npartners. As for next time, let\u2019s go out for sea cucumber.\nAttention, everyone! We have some news!\nYes, Classroom of the Elite will be turned into a manga! When I\nreceived the news from the publisher, I was extremely ecstatic, really happy.\nIchino Yuyu-sama will draw the manga. I sincerely look forward to working\nwith you. I\u2019m very much looking forward to when the series will begin\nserialization in January!\nPhew. Now then, how about we get to the postscript? No, there\u2019s one\nmore thing to report. Actually, in the previous postscript, there was one other\nthing I wrote about besides the sashimi story. I think no one else cares about\nthis at all, but it\u2019s a story that makes me hang my head in shame when I\nremember.\nI\u2019ll come out and say it. This is to my past self:\nDid you seriously mean to say something like \u201cI\u2019ve already finished\nthe manuscript early\u201d?\nYou moron! Idiot! You fool! You wound up eating your own words!\n", "Yes! You completely messed it up! Way out of bounds! Yes, I ended up\ncausing a lot of trouble for my editor. Even now, as I\u2019m writing this\npostscript, I can see the tear stains of my dear editor, who works so diligently.\nThe tears just won\u2019t stop coming.\nYou really are an idiot, Kinugasa-kun! Reflect on your faults!\nPhew. The guilty Kinugasa has reflected. You can rest assured of that.\nTherefore, the Kinugasa who has reflected on his actions dares to say, \u201cI will\ndefinitely finish more quickly next time!\u201d Then, he will write it.\nAnd I\u2019ll add that I\u2019ll be sorry if I\u2019m late again!\nWell everyone, I will report on the results again next time, in the next\nvolume. Hopefully it\u2019ll be good news!\n", "Author:\nSyougo Kinugasa\nBorn in November. Blood type: AB. Primarily responsible for scenario\nand PC game planning.
